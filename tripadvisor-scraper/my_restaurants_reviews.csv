Every time we go downtown, there is no wondering which place to pick for quick snacks, desserts, gourmet sandwiches.The sandwich with ham and coffee is really tasty and it is our favourite. Apple and cinnamon muffins, cheesecake, quiches, eggs - everything is cooked with care and love.Quite recently, I tried hummus and I must say - one of a kind! The people next to us asked us about it and I could see they were amazed only by the look of it.You can also order catering for your business meetings, cocktail and wedding party.",Definitely worth it!

review_601046189,2018-07-30,42.691475,23.322126,Daro,100,"We went for brunch on a Sunday. The restaurant is in the city center, small, and run by two gentlemen who speak English and are quite nice (my partner is Bulgarian, but alas, I am language challenged in this part of Europe). The restaurant has only a few tables, but we had no problem with seating. The food was great: veggie omelet, a spicy omelet (one of the daily specials), and french toast dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with a mandarin(?) glaze. We also had freshly squeezed juice and espresso. The food was fantastic and cooked to order. There are also pastries and muffins available and there are daily specials that I assume rotate. Just go. You'll like it. A lot. I don't need to say anything more.",Great for brunch,926B7F6E790D8224157E530478E10F93

But we were looking for a table service restaurant to have a lazy lunch and this place is self service / fast food type of place, more for to go food or a quick bite at lunch or over a drink. So if you need to brunch, have a coffee or grab a bite on the run - this is the place for you - the food is very good, lots of options too. When we were there it was extra crowded and nosy, the place is small, only a few tables and they don't actually have a full menu...tourists mainly pointed fingers to the displayed foods and hoped they chose well, as I personally don't know what I ate (but it was good).

The food was not so bad but the service was awful. The restaurant was not so full /there were around 20 people/ and almost all of the menu was not available.

Ok, we are here, we will try the food at least.You start to read the menu and you get to the point where is written that you are obliged to leave 10% tax service, as this is not a law in Bulgaria. So no matter if i am happy with the service or not, I must pay for someones lazyness eventually. Overpriced place for sure. And please, do not explane to me for the small farms and organic products, as i am a buyer and i know almost every single producing cost of the products and not only in Bulgaria.However, ordered hot ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù with liquer - not good, because you are not using hot chocolate, but a but of cocoa - your place, your decision, just do not lie to the customers.Food was not bad, but for sure nothing worthing the cost of it, portions are enough, not big, not small.

review_628609702,2018-10-26,42.69315,23.330639,Bagri,100,"I booked a table for 8 people to celebrate my birthday, and chose Bagri as I was excited to find a restaurant in Sofia that seems to practice the farm to table ethos. I myself try to eat organic, locally sourced food as far as possible, so the concept resonated with me.We arrived slightly after 8:30pm on a Friday to find a half-empty restaurant (with most tables already served). Despite this it took over 15 minutes to be able to place our order. We then had a long wait for drinks - possibly another 15 minutes. Again, I repeat the restaurant had at most another 10 patrons. We had a small child with us, for whom I requested some cut up cucumber. I was told that everything in their restaurant is portioned, so they weren't sure it they had any extra cucumber. Now if this were a portion of roast meat, or oysters, I'd understand. But what kind of restaurant runs on an exact count of cucumbers and has no additional provisions?? There were other items on the (very condensed) menu that were also not available. The elusive cucumber, we were told, was found, but 45 minutes later we still did not have it.After having sat on a completely empty table for 45 minutes, I asked the waitress if they had some bread or nibbles. I was told they did have bread, but it was sold by the portion. On a matter of principle I found it outrageous that a restaurant where prices are well over double what you'd expect in other good places in Sofia would want to charge you for bread, which in the first place was only requested because of their appallingly slow service. I had to ask two different waitresses for a sheet of paper to keep our increasingly hungry kid occupied, and even that menial task took 10 minutes in am empty restaurant (at this point there were only 2 other tables occupied).One hour into this experience, we had had enough, and asked to pay for our drinks and leave. They then seemed to scramble and say that everything was ready, but no one in our party had any desire to wait further. The bill took another 5 minutes, at which point they appeared with two starters, which were left uneaten.Sadly, I can't comment on the quality of the food, and I was looking forward to loving this place. Aside from the inexplicable slowness, I also find that they take themselves too seriously and there is an air of pretentiousness about the place that just did not sit well with me. There is zero sense of hospitality - the staff was certainly polite, but far from welcoming.I also noted that the only patrons of the restaurant were foreigners - clearly a tripadvisor side effect, which is the reason I am taking the time for the first time in years to write a review here.",A highly disappointing experience,F36768210C9227DD704303DC3CBA9BDB

Great and personal service with a timid smile.We arrived on time, finding that the booking was indeed taken, but misunderstood. Instead of 19:30 it was set to 9:30 PM. Our nice waiter instantly understood where it went wrong, apologized and found us a table. A nice sharing table on the first floor - in a room with three tables.We had starters to share (hummus and grilled cheese) and could have stopped there, but no - we had more (chicken) and loved every bite. The hummus was probably the best I've ever had, the cheese was a bit flat. The chicken was great.To the food we had bulgarian wine (a first for me), and enjoyed it - with food. It was to much on the sweet side to have it alone as just a white to sip on.The portions were big and the price was low. All in all a great combination.

I can back two days later after my work had concluded for the day. The weather was still comfortable so I say outside. The service was prompt and professional. My drink order was taken immediately and i was rewarded a short time later with a large local beer. The menu is extensive, but since i wanted local food i gravitated towards the grilled meats and sausages section. I was ordered some local lamb with a few sides. What a treat, the meat was cooked perfectly, and the sides delicious.

We were very pleased we chose Made in Home. The place is warm and relaxed. The tables are set to ensure you can have close conversations and hear one another.The service was friendly and the waiter spoke excellent English. The smell upon entering the restaurant was very appealling and delicious. The homemade veggie soup was full of flavour and not heavy with cream. The chicken wrap with roast veggies was perfectly balanced and seasoned and warm. The vegan ans vegetarian options were delightful. The goats cheese salad was abundant with cheese and leaves and the hummus plate with roasted vegetables was perfectly done.It is a lovely place and we all wished we had time in Sofia to come back for dinner!,Delightful homemade fresh and tasty meals,68703C2D5C1A05EE433939EF98BC9083

The waiting staff are all Bulgarian. They speak good English (though no Hindi) and are very friendly. The food itself is very good, as least as good as a lot of places in London. Perhaps not quite as good as Birmingham but enjoyable enough. I ordered a Dopiaza, which turned our to be a lot more like a Lebabda but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Between that, with rice, my starter and a nan bread I was completely stuffed. Just what I needed.

I'm jealous that this place isn't in London so I can visit more frequently.I'm a huge fan of spicy curry and, while it's only got a slight kick by my standard, the Lamb Khaltada was an incredibly tasty dish, and so different to standard dishes in flavour. The lamb was very tender as well. My girlfriend ordered a chicken Vinbraban Aloo dish, less spicy but no less flavoursome, and again really different to anything I had tried before.Couldn't recommend enough, even if it isn't local cuisine!My picture is of the popadum chutney which was the same sauce as my curry interestingly enough, served hot too!","Fantastic place, with a kick",1EB77F368F82602091823D1FFF52C247

The area is quite small not even enough space for staff to move around the tables. Not sure if it is supposed to be self-serve (since some people mention the waiters), but you have to get the menu yourself, order at the desk and then pick up your food and drinks from there (not always you can hear when they say the food is ready and it is easy to mess it up).

It has a lovely cosy atmosphere with quirky decor. The food is all freshly prepared ,which sometimes means they run out of some salads, but the selection is large and they're all great so it's nothing to worry about just have a back-up option ready. The menu is updated often and they always have a pasta and dessert of the day.The food itself is second to none, I've enjoyed every dish for at each of my visits and can never resist ordering 3 courses (even when we tried to stop ourselves at dessert we were served a chocolate cake in the house to share).What really makes it though is the service. You can see the passion and care they have about their food and their customers. My friend and I tried to get in on a busy night (do book ahead) and they sat us at the 'bar area' and served us a glass of free wine because they has just finished sampling it for the menu.I'll be a regular here for a long time to come and highly recommend it.",Favourite restaurant in Bulgaria!,69D073FA412C28D0986E19AAF82B9703

review_618892732,2018-09-23,42.693638,23.332096,La Capannina,100,"Have to address the elephant in the room first: this place would be considered expensive even in most Italian cities. And setting price at this level means that customer is allowed to expect more.Service was excellent. Decor outdated and little stale (terrace furniture had an unmistakable stench from years of cigarette smoking).Seabass carpaccio: biggest problem here was that it wasn't a carpaccio at all. Fish was cooked fully. Taste OK, though nothing special. But for heavens sake, don't call it a carpaccio.Caprese: mozzarella was not very high quality. That could have been forgiven, but the rose tomatoes they used were rather on the raw side (and yes, I do know what a rose tomatoe is).Spinach filled ravioli: best portion of the bunch. Ravioli just sliglthy overcooked.Seafood with porcini pasta: it's very clear that the chef had either not tasted the portion or doesn't have any clue. The garlic was burned, giving that ah so terrible stingy taste and smell that you could notice even from the other side of the table. For 39lev that is unacceptable. Waiter apologized when we pointed this out, but no other action taken.Eggplant-parmesan: too heavy on the tomato sauce, which overpowered other tastes. But otherwise a passable course.Excellent house red, though for 16lev a glass it really should be.Sofia has many nice Italian restaurants. But I definitely don't include La Capannina on that list, sorry. Even if the price was half of what it was, it still wouldn't make the list.",Amazingly expensive,AE62DEB0F8D46E464E3812CF5FB22F3C

Service is brilliant, punctual and listening to feedback. Unfortunately food was poor. I assume this is tempo, as they hav3 a new cook, but this doesn't change the fact. Menu is tapas oriented and far from being abundant. 3-4 mains, 10 tapas and salads. Out of what we ordered only the bruschettas were ok, the lamb chops were hard to chew, carciofi was overboiled, the skewers weren't marinated well. We got a compliment from 5hem, so I think they are concerned with the situation and there will be a change. Wine list is abundant and affordable.

One evening we (my oldest son and I) took the taxi and headed for the bar at Madrid Avenue.

We took the three beers on tab that came from Bulgaria, the others were from (of course) the Netherlands and other countries. The beers were great and then we tried an IPA from a bottle and at last the owner (which who we had a mutual friend in the Netherlands) came at our table and offered us a nice dessert-beer from Pojala.Both the beers, music and company made our evening well spent in KANAAL.

It's all about the simplicity of pasta and at the same about the little details.I think a story will describe my feelings about Bistro Pesto the best. During one of my first visits, I was looking to pick up some pasta for takeaway. So, I stopped by, ordered two beef and two cheese pastas and was asked to come back to pick it up in 20 minutes. So, I go in 20 minutes, but I have no cash on me, just cards. It was the owner who was at the cashier and he could not get the POS to work. I was like 'no problem, I'll go get some cash from the ATM' when he looks at me and I can feel he is quite frustrated all ready and says ""NO, take it & go! I don't like pasta cold."" Ofc, he gave me the receipt, but did not even ask me when I will be coming back to pay him.

Have to admit that we were a bit dissapointed about the dishes. The foie gras was actually more like a butter with a taste of a foie gras, the beef tartar had a lot onion in. Though the koba carpaccio was excellent. As well as the star wars and a mandarine desserts. The beef wellington was average minus, but the great dissapointment was the lobster tarmidore. It was way too sweet, and had much more taste of the vegetables that were the main part of the dish ( like zuccinni), than of a lobster. When we asked to return the dish and take something instead it for the main course, the cheff refused. The waiter gave us a couple slices of lemon, for squeeze on it and put on it some smoked sause to reduce the sweeteness. It didn't help much and the dish still was not tasty for us.

I had seen positive reviews before arriving so was keen to check it out. It proved to be one of the best places I ate at in the Bulgarian capital and I would very happily return on any future visits. Its appearance is modern and sophisticated and the menu and service were similar. I enjoyed an excellent three course meal which was very well presented and tasted delicious. The beef wellington main was a delight and the foaming dessert truly eye-opening - a real culinary joy! I asked for advice about a good Bulgarian red wine to accompany the food and was very pleased with the server's recommendation. The staff here were friendly and helpful and not at all officious as one sometimes finds in top class restaurants all over the world. The restaurant is not especially cheap by Bulgarian standards but at around 45 euros (¬£40 GBP) I thought it was very good value indeed for food of such quality.

Good gimmick you get your glass and open the tap at your table , it clocks up as you pour and you settle up at the end. Probably ok in the evening, but we didn't go back as the customer experience was shocking. Was ask if we were going to eat , we said no and was just grunted at and pointed to a table, the guy was miserable and un interested, on the way in I had 2 men starring at me outside , we exchanged words only to find they worked here also. Door man up top of stairs also had no personality. My advise to the management take your team up the road to the New Fox and Hounds and watch how staff should be have.

The restaurant is the best we‚Äôve been to and the service was brilliant. It is a little bit more upper market than the other restaurants but 100% worth. All the food was amazing as was the wine. The only recommendation I would make to people going here is that the steaks are priced per 100g and the steak you get may be 300g/600g depending on which type you get, however the waiter did tell us of this and it didn‚Äôt put us off ordering the steak which was out of this world.

Indeed I am a regular in this place.On starters - They have just sufficient variety in the appetisers. I tried almost all, however, one needs a separate page. Please try their veal carpaccio with truffles on the season - i.e. fall. It is great. The meat is cut so thin and well blended with the truffle. Its so tasty. You even hesitate to have balsamic on top or not, just for the sake of not ruining the taste.On mains - I love their steaks. They have a good variety, its always well curated and aged before served. The chef know how to cook and serve - which is probably the key competency a steakhouse kitchen team should have. I also like the sides they serve. The only under-rated thing in the restaurant is the truffle cream tehy serve with fries. ƒ± believe they need to work a bit more on the taste of the cream. A soft and mild cheese may elevate the taste of the cream to the level its required.Also they have great service, great sommelier, and a very wide cava.

We didn't make a fuzz because we were likely to empty two anyway.Two out of seven dishes were hot. The five others were almost cold. We asked them to heat up five side dishes and one main dish. This however took so long (approximately half an hour) that of course the main dishes were finished by the time the side dish was served and one person was left eating alone. It was so bad that at a certain point the waiters were actively avoiding us as not to have to explain how the kitchen could mess up so bad.After complaining even more, the side dishes and the cold main were taken off the bill, we were however still left with an expensive dinner, especially by Bulgarian standards.",More disappointing as the night progressed,83B3D84A16E05C997FEB323BDD6ECEBC

Not far away from the action but far away not to hear the noise.The food, well, It's tasty. There's plenty of options in the menu (even some veggie stuff if you or someone from your group is a veggie). I think that the meat was cooked exactly how it should be cooked - not raw, nor overcooked.The staff is polite, smiling (which is a big thing for me because nowadays staff can be polite but putting a smile is the next step) and helpful.I can't leave all positive review, soooo.... the thing that I don't like is the poor selection of beers. If the guys from BoomBurgers bring more beers to the menu, I'm definitely sure that it will attract more customers (because when the food is good, the booze should be good too)!Go to the restaurant, people.

The staff, dressed in traditional Bulgarian garbs, will serve you with always a smile on the face.With live folkloristic music in the eveninig, the atmosphere is always cheerful and upbeat, ideal for both couple, small and bigger groups.For those seeking to gain an overall picture of the culinary delights that Bulgaria has to offer, this is definitely the go-to place.I suggest to start with a taste of their earth: roasted marinated pepper, chillis with garlic and eggplant puree ideal for bread dipping.As main, move on to their meat assortment and it will be very hard to choose among pork, chicken or lamb specialties. To help you, I recommend to pick at least two meats (both in pics):- Chicken shashlik (skewer) garnished with fried potatoes, chutney, onions and beans;- Lamb roasted in wood oven on Saint George's way with rice, vegetables and green salad.

review_595205636,2018-07-11,42.67222,23.319025,Captain Cook,80,"I travel quite a bit professionally, usually prefer fish and seafood restaurants almost anywhere, including at home, and when my wife travels with me we are picky and often splurge. Before going to Captain Cook in Sofia we did our research, arrived wet from a thunderstorm, and left 3 hours later more than satisfied and without splurging too much.Once you pass through the hotel lobby with an atrocious decor, the atmosphere,the decor and waters in general become much calmer . A very professional waiter accompanied us throughout, spoke excellent English and more importantly gave excellent advice. My wife is allergic to many ingredients but he passed this test with flying colors. He also doubled as sommelier since I did not recognize some of the wines (the wine-list is OK, no more).But we came for the food. You are led to a big open fridge with today's catch, impressive and fresh for a restaurant nowhere near an ocean. We picked a lot of small dishes and various ways of preparation. All were shining in their freshness and excellently prepared. If I had to chose, I would give the chef at the barbecue the gold medal, all the rest are silver.

I came around 6 pm on Saturday and even though almost whole restaurant was empty, I was told that all the tables are reserved and I can have a table for an hour. This was fine for me as I was alone and just wanted to have some Bulgarian food, but keep in mind that if you are a party of 2 or more, it would be vise to make a reservation.

Certainly not a patch on a good restaurant in Thailand. I had the prawn with vegetables dish which was well enough cooked and presented but it only contained four prawns...yes just four small prawns. The banana fritters were okay-to-decent but again a long way from the best I've had. Pricewise I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it's slightly dear compared to the norm in Sofia. However I wouldn't put anyone off going here if you're looking for some variety in your dining habits.

review_628509041,2018-10-26,42.69162,23.338097,Restaurant Shtastliveca,100,"First of all there are several branches of this restaurant. I went to the one at San Stefano street. The main place is on the second floor and its huge. It gives the feeling of a bit fabrication for people who like more causy environments like myself. However, as we went there for a business dinner, we were located in a private room which gave me the taste I was looking for.Coming to the menu, I think its too log and too confusing. For example the mains have several types of food - like meat balls, sausages, etc. Putting each protein type combined with the food type (e.g. lamb sausage, pork sausage, etc.) as a single item in the menu extends it unnecessarily and makes it confusing for the guest. Richness of the menu does not come from the number of items, but rather depth of it. The place definitely lacks the discipline of having a decent, proper, clean sheet menu.On the other, the taste of the food, if you can manage to find what to order within the mess, is quite beyond expected. Looking at the menu and the space, I expected nothing more than a standard diner on the corner. However the food that came surprised me. Overall the quality, freshness and taste of the raw food is high in Bulgaria. Lamb or veal is great, same as pork, veggies are always fresh. Hence its hard to mess in that combination. However, these guys took the good quality material and even elevated it further to make it something great. I had lamb shank - it was delicious. Try it please. On starters I had pepper stuffed with goat cheese, goat cheese melt, chopska salad, shepherds salad, Caesar salad. Caesar was ok, was missing the touch of anchovies in its sauce, but the rest was great. Pepper was especially great. Try it as well. I had a chance to taste from colleagues that had Red Snapper of a huge size, it was great and served extremely in fashion.Overall food quality was great.In essence, if you are looking for some good food on an everyday night go to this place. For business entertainment, you may prefer this place as well. However, its not good for candle light dinners. I recommend this place all in all.","Wide menu, above average taste, good service - Like a black suit",801B821972C39B9F543C6D6B698FDBD1

So, when we are guests of L'Etranger, we feel France with all our senses. Now, we was here in the spring/summer, when is seafood season. The daily menu of this nice bistro includes mussels and paella. Of course, we were curious to taste everything :) Believe me, we will remember these mussels and magnifique paella forever. So fresh, full of flavor and with typical French presentation. The owners of the restaurant kindly propose us to combinate these nice dishes with one special for seafood French wine - Picpoul de Pinet‚Ä¶.it was really one impressive and so delicious combination.

L'Instant set out to make catering and the Gastrotheque, where Danny Spartak from Hell's Kitchen was the chef, is closed. The only place where you can taste French specialties is L'Etranger.'L'entrager' means 'the stranger', 'the foreigner' in French. There is also a Camus novel, The Stranger, in which he, typically about the era and his style, emphasizes absurdity and existentialism.But there is nothing like that here. No one feels alien - Bulgarians and French are at home and do not care about Camus' views.See ........ Chic!- It's like entering a real French bistro;.... Details that delicately takes you to Paris - a bicycle with a basket of flowers, straw hat, flowers, city clocks, paintings, pictures!Feel ........ Like home - courteous service, very friendly to children, contact is extraordinary;.... All French guests of Sofia and ex-pat should learn about this place- everybody speaks French there;... Crunch-Crunch Salty Finger or Sea Green Beans, I'm very fond of it and it escorts almost all of the dishes!Hear ....... Jazzy Sax and then French chanson - for true Parisian spirit.Smell ...... Slight cinnamon in cappuccino with nettle, which is actually a soup of nettle topped with potato foam, served in a cup;... The exotic smell of coriander in Vietnamese spring rolls - an absolutely vegan dish, suitable for salad, with fresh, very finely chopped vegetables in rice bark, served with a sweet-sour sauce, wonderfully fresh and aromatic.Taste ....... A plate with home-made pastes with duck rillets, hummus, olives pesto, butter with anchovies, corned duck meat- only the rillets did not impress me because they are more fatty, but this anchovy butter, the corned duck meat and humus just lay down on my heart - unique, one of my daughters did not stop stealing them from me!;.... Frog legs - served with saut√©ed spices (I sensed garlic, coriander, parsley, butter) so delicious, and a lovely crispy Salty Finger on the side (I found it funny that the dish was written as ""frogs"" in the bill);... Freshly baked bread and olives with Provencal spices, which the children ate up in no time and wanted more.For more details about L'Etranger or rate&reviews about other interesting places in Bulgaria and the world, explore my blog placescases.com","YOU FEEL LIKE HAVING AN AUTHENTIC FRENCH CUISINE?

My daughter found this three minutes walk away. We were a bit nervous at first as there is no sign and it is to say the least minimally furnished. But wow!, what a fabulous meal we had a wide variety of veggie and meat dishes between the four of us and all were delicious. Service is shall we say relaxed,you help yourself to beer from the fridge, dishes are sometimes brought to the table, sometimes collected from the counter which all adds to the laid back freindly atmosphere. Prices are ridiculously cheap. Between four of us We had 6 dishes plus salad, bread 2 beers some wine and soft drinks and the bill was under 60 lev.

However, if you order a burger, it might take some time (we waited 15min). My soup came immediately, however my partner's burger wasn't ready when I finished my soup.Perhaps it would be good to ask (if more than 1 customer) to get the food together. Also, maybe not very appropriate to eat in front of your customers while they are waiting for their food. Food in overall was quite nice, the soup was light and simple, but nice. The burger was very nice, but the meat was a bit dry, with a texture more like a sausage. Prices could be cheaper, as there is a lot of competition out there.",Decent,BADF8DA3616B19671B54EC99695C50B7

Menus included English so no problem ordering (staff also spoke English so no trouble at all)Food was superb. Two of us had pork ribs that were very tasty, tender, with appropriate sauce.

Menu was similar so we knew exactly what we wanted. My favourite of Vegetable soup with a skewer of prawns the waiter told us was off. Then he went to the kitchen and said it was on again. He asked whether we wanted brown or white bread. We replied brown to which he said we don't have that...so why ask??. They no longer had house wine, and we had small bottles, which were not good. When the food came it was barely warm so they took it away to reheat in the microwave. We had a feeling they had sent out for the vegetable soup as they initially said they didn't have it. It was very bland and lacking in vegetables. When we came to pay, with credit card they said their machine wasn't working, it only works on weekends?? we were on the way to the airport and had limited cash so scraped together a mixture of Euro and Bulgarian Lei.
