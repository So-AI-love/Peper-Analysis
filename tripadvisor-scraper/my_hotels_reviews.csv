The rooms are comfortabl, clean and air conditioned, breakfast is great. It is easy to get around to the center of Sofia and Ludmill will help guide you to whatever you would like to do around Sofia or other parts of Bulgaria.

Not only is he the part owner, but he's the friendliest host I've ever encountered, whether in an airbnb setting or a hotel setting. He always has a smiling face and a can-do attitude. There is nothing that he wouldn't mind doing to make your stay more enjoyable and comfortable. We needed to keep the room for a few more hours to freshen up on the way out. No problem. We needed to be picked up at the airport as we were not renting a car for the one day we were spending in Sofia. No problem. We needed a ride to the bus station when leaving. No problem. We had questions about food and local transportation. No problem. We wanted to learn about the city and the country - Ludmil made a very information presentation on the history of the city and the country on our way over to Casa Ferrari.Bottom line: We would stay at Casa Ferrari just to spend time with Ludmil (all other reasons notwithstanding)!",Ludmil is the man!!,C5C4A8239B6DB1219839DF3C6FD579C6

The B&B is on the ground floor of an apartment building. We had a large room with high ceilings, hardwood floors and oak furniture, plus a comfortable private bath.The proprietor was very helpful and pointed us, immediately, to a free walking tour that helped orient us to Sofia and let us plan out the next day. Like most other things, we were able to get to the walking tour on foot.Everything is clean and comfortable.

review_586063322,2018-06-08,42.691116,23.312674,Casa Ferrari B&B,100,"My wife and I decided to visit our native country Bulgaria this year. After being in USA for 24 years and post previous visits, in average of once in 3-4 years, we were expecting to become better and better in many aspects of life. And we were right. We found Casa Ferrari, a cosy nice B&B hotel in central part of Sofia on a quiet street. It is a super place to be. You feel like at home. Rooms are simply perfect. The entire apartment place is with all necessary things to maintain a nice and relaxing stay. The service of Mr. Mandichev is world class. Professional, responsive, polite, helpful. Ludmil is doing superb job. He picked up us from the airport with very nice modern car and in no time we have been in the beautiful room to rest from the long trip. No hassle with taxi drivers that are generally nice but could be an unusual trip (no fresh air in the car, not finding the place right away, etc.). With the manager and owner of the place we got no waiting for taxi and we were sure he will not take a long road to the hotel. The place is located in a very good heart part of the capital. Easy connections are available by public transportation as well. There are nice pretty restaurants in a walking distance too. When you need taxi just pick up the phone in the hotel no need to remember a number, press a button and the dispatcher replies and the taxi comes in 3-5 minutes. I am so glad we found that place to stay.And as usual when you travel unexpected things happened. This time I forgot my cell phone in the place after leaving it and already locking it with the keys inside. We were in a hurry and had to travel to a different town for a day. Next day Mr. Mandichev was waiting for us at a convenient place in the capital with my cell phone. My trip was saved. My whole vacation was good. Now I know where to stay when I go to Sofia. The answer is simple Casa Ferrari. This place deserves 9.8-10.0 Thank you!!!",Visit Sofia and feel like being at home,7548FC068B2C935321388C20C5046211

review_557858946,2018-02-01,42.691116,23.312674,Casa Ferrari B&B,100,"Casa Ferrari B&B is a cosy and comfortable B&B in the heart of Sofia. From day 1, the owner, Ludmil has been fast and responsive in his communications to me. I got to know that Ludmil provides pick up service at a reasonable price and since we arrived very late at night, Ludmil was already waiting for our arrival at the airport. Ludmil does not stay at the B&B but nearby. The B&B is very clean and cosy with beautiful italian styled furniture. The room and bathroom is spacious. Coffee and tea is always available and you can make it yourself at the kitchen. Ludmil also provides wonderful breakfast everyday and chats with us while we are having our breakfast. He's very knowledgeable and we have enjoyable and lively conversations with him. The B&B is walking distance to 2 different metro stops and you can also walk to almost everywhere as well. The main shopping street - Vitosha Boulevard is around 15 mins away by walking. The B&B is in a quiet but secure lane. You have to have a pass to enter the building and then a key to enter the main door of the apartment and finally a key to your room. We enjoyed the walks from the B&B to the sights. Along the B&B, there are food shops and small shops selling knickknacks. Ludmil is always there to provide assistance and information should you need it. He can also take you on day trips to Rilla Monastry. Our flight leaving Sofia was late night and Ludmil kept our luggages at the main area as there was already a guest coming in the afternoon.We enjoyed our stay and hope to stay again at Case Ferarri in the future.",Charming and cosy,2590F3E3E4B1385C1260440C3BC31C7E

So, a mixed bag, but on the whole a good experience.",Traditional hotel in great location,F7E13C43E11BB8CF2E1B80E2CF4A7217

review_632963351,2018-11-12,42.69403,23.324863,Grand Hotel Sofia,80,"We stayed at the hotel twice during our 17 days touring Bulgaria. The hotel is centrally located which is always a plus. The rooms (401 and 409), facing the street, were huge with a sitting area in one corner. There was a minibar, a bottle of water for each guest every day, and in the draw next to each bed there were a complimentary condom and a sewing kit. Such service. My roommate liked the tub in the spacious bathroom. Our rooms were spotless. There were even a decent bedside reading light. In fact we marveled at the many small lamps in the bedroom. Electrical outlets to power our gadgets were no problems.The breakfast was quite a spread. I especially liked the table with Bulgarian delicacies. In my view, the coffee served in the dining room was not great. But one could always buy a cappuccino or espresso from the bar. The staff was somewhat reserved and not overly friendly.

review_634466420,2018-11-19,42.69808,23.315641,Central Hotel Sofia,100,"Stayed here for 5 days toward end of October, and found the place absolutely faultless.Very easy to find, being only a few minutes walk from the city centre and close to all Sofia's main attractions, shops and restaurants. Check in nice and easy, thankfully the chap on reception spoke perfect English. Slight delay getting my room ready, as I arrived an hour early, but was able to have a drink in the lobby area while waiting. The room was lovely. Large, extremely tidy, a massive TV with about 50 channels (most in English) and a reasonably priced (by hotel standards) mini-bar. Shower room and loo were pristine, and kept that way daily by the wonderful 'Lilli' (she left a card with her name which is a nice personal touch, I feel!), who definitely deserves a mention for her efficiency.The breakfast was a standard European buffet type, but plenty of everything, so you could have a great load-up to start your day. The restaurant itself had a slightly limited menu for such an excellent hotel, but there were sufficient choices at reasonable prices if you decided not to eat out. Check out on the final day nice and easy, decided to get an airport shuttle provided by the hotel at less than 10 English pounds.All in all, this is a near faultless hotel, and anyone coming to Sofia on a budget can't beat this place for value, efficiency and friendliness.",Best value hotel ever,29DBB3B180203795BF9078B9548FCC6D

The valet service for car parking was super fast and super convenient. We waited for less than 5 minutes for our car to be retrieved. Breakfast was the usual and included meat and cheese, eggs, bacon, sausages, salad fixings and fruit. All was good. The rooms were comfortable, but the shower and fittings were very high end. The rainshower had loads of pressure and was a joy to use. I had two spa treatments which were some of the best I have had.

review_622563789,2018-10-06,42.681488,23.319777,Hilton Sofia,100,"We were here for a one-week conference and everything was excellent. The room was comfortable, had a work space with chair, plus another comfy chair. In-room coffee/tea service included reg AND decaf coffee, as well as nice herbal, green, and black teas. In-room frig stocked with items for purchase but room to leave personal water bottles or other small items. Our housekeeper Emilia was amazing—not only was our room thoroughly cleaned, but she did many small touches to make the room look pretty and us as guests feel special. The hair dryer is attached to the wall but is at least a model that is easy to use and works well. The in-rooom safe is large enough for a laptop plus small bags, etc. The standard wifi worked well in the room (we were on 3rd floor) and throughout hotel. The breakfast buffet was substantive, excellent variety, always well-stocked, and the staff were always attentive and helpful and pleasant. You can also request made-to-order omelettes in addition to the scrambled eggs and hard boiled eggs in the buffet. The pool is small and not designed for swimming laps, but it is warm and excellent for exercising or relaxing. The outdoor solarium is lovely, with cushions, umbrellas, many lounge chairs, towels all supplied. the changing room has hair dryer, toilets, and showers. The exercise room is also small but has multiple types of equipment. A very positive feature is that this area is always staffed so going alone late at night it is comforting to have their presence. We found the front desk staff to all be helpful as well, all spoke English, some quite well. They helped with recommendations, making restaurant reservations, and other needs. Overall, this was an excellent stay and I would highly recommend, and would return if the occasion presents itself. It is a 5-minute walk from a shopping center, and a 5-minute walk over the bridge to access the city center. All very convenient.

review_635650194,2018-11-25,42.707485,23.326649,Budapest Hotel,80,"This hotel is the best option for budget / mid range travelers by car. Our room was huge (deluxe double), bathroom with big bathtub, everything clean, tiny French balcony (but good for smoking). Staff is extra nice, always smiling and helpful. The decor of the room is a bit plane and it's kinda dark, but this was a small minus for us. Also bed and pillows a bit hard, but got used to them after the first night. There's no central heating, but a huge AC. This means that there's no heating when you are away and in November it was cold when we got back, but fortunately the AC heats up the room very quick. Also AC a bit noisy even on low power mode for all night use for a light sleeper. Location wise it's at a walkable distance from center (10-12 min). Yes, it's not right in the center, but for a weekend break it's perfectly manageable. There is a tram stop in front and a metro stop 5 min walk if you prefer transport; we enjoyed walking. The big plus is the free parking in front of the hotel and this was the reason we chose this hotel. A bit weird that you have to leave your car key at reception for the whole stay, as they move around the cars. But more central hotels charge parking separately and this ads up a lot to the cost of the room. Breakfast was great for 3 star, hot and cold options, English breakfast type. Did not eat at their restaurant, but ordered room service and food came quickly and was very good. Wifi worked great during our stay.

It's welcoming, efficient and comfortable and perfect after the evening flight from Stansted. The point of this review, however, is to pay tribute to the extraordinary lengths the manager and staff went to recently to recover an item of luggage I lost in the airport. This included checking cab numbers on CCTV, calling the taxi company and airport and, after two hours, letting me know the bag was found. They were both unstinting and understanding. The quality of management matters so much in an hotel and here the manager, and staff, are first class. Thank you.",Great hotel with wonderful staff,D52E091357012C7CE6FD92E2F613A414

review_616125181,2018-09-12,42.693733,23.320568,Les Fleurs Boutique Hotel,80,The best thing about this hotel is its central location in a main pedestrian street of the city. Rooms are ok.

review_612224199,2018-08-30,42.693733,23.320568,Les Fleurs Boutique Hotel,80,"It is a small hotel located in very center on pedestrian street. Keep in mind that many taxi drivers are not aware that hotel is on a corner of pedestrian street and a ‘car riding’ street. I had two incidents when taxi drivers tried to drop us off at the beginning of the pedestrian street which was two blocks from the hotel. I think it would be a big help for hotel guests if hotel provides ‘how to get to hotel’ or crossing street info on the booking sites.Room was small but very clean. One big minus (for me) was the glass shower cabin inserted in place of the wall that would divide a room and bathroom ...so when sitting/laying on the bed you practically can see what was going on in the bathroom especially in a shower cabin. It was very uncomfortable and created a lot of ‘no privacy’ situationsBreakfast was ok..pretty limited with choices.Reception desk.. very friendly people, always ready to help and accommodate your needs",Excellent location,31945F82BEE864E510FF0F63B718866E

Restaurants are abundant, as well as small markets and bakeries. The hotel was part of a multi-city package, so Pricing was not an issue, but published rates looked high for Bulgaria.

review_594114210,2018-07-08,42.693733,23.320568,Les Fleurs Boutique Hotel,80,"I nearly gave this hotel two stars rather than one because of the staff. With one exception they were friendly, helpful and considerate. Boris (Bellboy) was particularly helpful trying to sort out the a/c however I don’t think I can say the hotel is any more than “Terrible”.The biggest selling points about this hotel are that most of its staff is incredibly friendly and its location - on Vitosha Boulevard and within walking distance of most of the major sights.We booked a Panorama room here for three reasons: Firstly the Panorama rooms have balconies and we like rooms with balconies; secondly the hotel’s location is very good and, thirdly the hotel is highly rated on TA. The room was however very expensive for what we got. I was quoted a rate here that is as much per night as I pay for a one bedroom flat in Mayfair (the best address in London, UK) except here the rate includes breakfast where in London it doesn’t. For what I am paying here I expect high standards in rooms, breakfast and service. Unfortunately this hotel doesn’t deliver in either the room or breakfast.The room is a decent size. It’s divided into three areas. Sitting, sleeping and dressing, with a bathroom and balcony. The bathroom has both a bath and separate shower. The lighting in both these areas is on a motion detector meaning that if you stop moving in the bath the light goes out and the detector for the shower is hidden behind the shower head so that the light doesn’t come on when you’re in the shower just when you walk past. That said the shower is very strong and is amongst the best I’ve seen in a hotel. There are also two wash basins, a toilet and a bidet.The bed is comfortable but only comes with one pillow each - you really need two. There is a divider between the bed and sitting area incorporating a TV set. This divider will swing so that the TV can be viewed from either area.The balcony is a good addition to the room. It catches the sun and has good views over Vitosha Boulevard. There is a sun blind but there’s no indication of how to open it - not that it’s needed as there’s no patio furniture and nowhere to sit. There is a window box on the balcony however all it contains are a few dead plants and some weeds.There are light switches by the bed that don’t appear to do anything. You have to get out of bed and walk across the room to put the lights off. There are switches all round the room but we never found out what they all do. The buttons to lower the blinds on the windows are by the door - you can’t see the windows from the door! There is a blind on the balcony door but we never found the switch to lower it.When we got to the room it was incredibly hot - 27C if the display in the room is to be believed. The A/C didn’t appear to be working so we asked the receptionist. He told us to make sure that the “mode” was set to “cool” - the button at the top left when you open the front cover. Occasionally - two or three times a day - the display changes to say “Check”. The fans still run but the temperature just goes up and up. We complained about the excessive temperatures every day that we were in the hotel. The receptionist kept assuring me that it was only 19C in the room despite the staff having measured the temperature with a thermometer and agreed that the room was at about 27C! The staff tried cleaning the filters, adjusting the controls, etc but never managed to solve the problem.There are no facilities to make tea or coffee. We brought our own travel kettle and kept milk in the fridge.Breakfast is poor, well below what i would expect for a hotel of this standard. All coffee if from a machine - I’ve tried five different kinds so far and found them all well below satisfactory. There are some very unusual items - like cold toasted cheese sandwiches and the hot food is left uncovered which means it’s actually cold. Breakfast is served in the lobby of the hotel with doors open to the outside. There is no method of fly control visible and there are flies on the buffet. They seem to run out of things and don’t restock. On Tuesday morning there was no jam and only one Assam and one black tea bag. For our final two mornings we took our own tea bags with us - We’re not English men who expect the world to serve us tea the way we drink it at home however all the coffees here are so bad and there is so little choice in tea that we found taking our own the best solution. On our last morning in particular the selection was very poor with no fresh fruit at all and very little by way of pastries. Once we had checked out and spoken to the manager we noted that the buffet looked much better (although still poor).When we first got to the hotel there was no WIFI and we had to ask twice for the problem to be resolved - which it was. Partway through our stay the signal failed again - we didn’t bother complaining but used my phone as an internet hotspot. That was far more reliable.Our room was only accessible by one of the hotel’s three lifts. On our third day that lift failed. When we checked with reception we were told it would be out for another four or five days. The lift was working again for our departure.My husband describes this hotel as being “Fur coat and no knickers”! He means that everything looks very grand but that there’s no substance to the hotel. I agree with him.By the end of our third night in this hotel we were looking forward to getting home; by the fourth morning we were desperate - we were packed and ready to leave the next day!We had encountered such horrendous problems that, at check out, we asked to speak to the manager to complain. He was very sympathetic. The Rack rate for a panorama room is € 300; I had been quoted a fete of € 220 by email and then € 200 in a final email. After speaking with the manager we agreed a rate of € 150 per night. I still think that is expensive for what we got but feel that a discount of € 70 per night is acceptable.I think this hotel is very expensive for what it offers. We won’t be returning and can’t recommend it.","""Fur Coat and no Knickers""",57C8A7BF09FE925C3DFC2FA7B30F4122
review_593701504,2018-07-07,42.693733,23.320568,Les Fleurs Boutique Hotel,80,"Let’s start with the one positive-this Hotel has a super-central location. Otherwise, our experience, staying twice-going to and coming from Varna was disappointing. Firstly, the rooms we were allocated-223 and 323 are tiny, located at the back of the hotel and look into a dismal courtyard with kitchen extractors discharging directly under the window. Oddly enough, both bathrooms are a good size, although the shower seal has gone in 323 and the bathroom floods comprehensively when you take a shower. Both rooms didn’t smell aired. We couldn’t get the electric curtain to close properly in 223 and dislodged one or two runners in the process for which we were scolded by reception. Breakfast was adequate but lack-lustre, distinguished on our return visit by a female member of staff grazing the buffet frequently. You help yourself to everything including coffee machineand there was nil interaction from the 4 members of staff in the kitchen area. As previously mentioned, no tea and coffee facilities in the room but they did bring some on our first night. I assume the dirty cups and saucers were removed at the end of our first two-night stay. This well-designed Hotel is now beginning to look a little neglected with peeling covering to display shelves in the dining area, mopping only to bathroom floors resulting in a discernible tide mark. I dropped a wet wipe on the bathroom floor and it was grubby. On balance, I would avoid.",Disappointing,0FEED4F05E649C63FA2083A5014C9C2A

Its a good hotel but there are some oddities.The room we had was excellent but there was a large bit of furniture at the end of the bed so that we couldn't easily get suit cases to the open space at the other side of the bed. Also our bathroom had a glass cylindrical shower embedded in the wall so you could basically see into the bathroom. This is okay as far as it goes but there are some things one wants privacy for.That said, the room and bed was very comfortable with one of the only actual double beds we slept in in Bulgaria and the breakfast was good and the location couldn't really be better with excellent restaurants and all the things you want to see just quite close.So over all good but a few weird things that could be better.",Excellent if slightly mad,5D023F0FE81C72E5519C46F4AC02879D

review_610948671,2018-08-27,42.68566,23.317093,Rosslyn Central Park Hotel,80,"We booked this hotel for an overnight stay before an early flight the next morning. One reason we booked this hotel was that there was a kettle in the room and we really appreciated that when we arrived and were able to make ourselves a coffee. The check in process was very quick and the room was clean and well presented. The hotel is in a great location just across the road from the cultural centre and park with magnificent fountains. We checked out at 4.00am and got a taxi to the airport (it is just a matter of pressing a button on the counter to call a taxi) and got through security. About an hour before our scheduled departure time of 6.15am we were informed that the flight was delayed with an expected departure time of 2.40pm. After debating what to do for a while I rang the hotel to ask if it would be possible to have the room again until check out time. I was told that this would not be a problem so we got a taxi back to the hotel and were given the keycard for our room again and told that we could stay till maybe 1.00pm. So about 7.30am we were able to go back to bed again for a few hours, then got up and had a shower before heading to the restaurant for a buffet breakfast which was very welcome. (it remains to be seen whether Ryanair will reimburse us the cost of breakfast but in the circumstances it was worth it anyway.) Being able to have the room again after we had checked out made all the difference to us - 5 hours in the hotel was bliss compared to 5 hours sitting about the airport. So thanks to Rosslyn Central Park for allowing us to do that. we would certainly use this hotel again. The free wi-fi was great too.",All round excellence,8292B20F8D3BC5F9885BEFAC3E6A26DA

review_598063421,2018-07-20,42.68566,23.317093,Rosslyn Central Park Hotel,80,"I stayed at the Rosslyn Central Park Hotel for a conference in the Palace of Culture (NDK). The hotel itself is pretty large but because there are only nine rooms per floor it feels more like a boutique hotel. There are many reviews that extol its virtues, so I’ll just add the some caveats that may be helpful. Half the rooms face the street and even with double pane windows you can hear the frequent street cars as they screech around the corner. Of course, the importance really depends on how sensitive you are to noise (I prefer really quiet rooms).The room layout is pretty much the same from floor to floor with high floors having more expansive windows. So, when I say room x01 just substitute the floor number for ‘x’. The quietest rooms are x01, x02, and x03, with x01 the quietest but unfortunately adjacent to the stairwell. By the 3rd floor it’s unlikely anyone will use the stairwell so you won’t be bothered by its noisy door (I was in room 301 after rejecting 408 and 404). Corner room x04 is problematic. One window faces away from the street (uninteresting view) while the other window faces the street car rail (noisy). I would avoid this room even though it’s somewhat larger. Rooms x05-x09 face the street with x09 being adjacent to the elevator, which can be annoying. The street views are quite nice. As for other items, the bathroom is well appointed but the shower door may leak water if you’re not careful and the tub is made from rolled steel giving you a wobbly shower experience. The hotel restaurant is decent but better options exist in the neighborhood. Cancellable rates at a reasonable price are readily available if you book early. However, if you book through a 3rd party site the hotel will not help you with any reservation changes and online changes are very dicey. I booked through Expedia and had to actually call them to adjust my dates. It was not a straightforward experience. OK, so now that I’ve detailed the issues; I want to say that I also support all the positive reviews. Using what I know, I would not hesitate to stay at the Rosslyn Central Park Hotel again.",Pretty nice all around,8F66040892B7EB0DC85C45B03A8A5FE3

review_634558537,2018-11-19,42.694866,23.31466,Hostel Mostel,100,"This hostel is located in a very nice building and the whole place has a a good layout. So much for the good stuff....Probably the biggest letdown with Hostel Mostel is the staff. They actually do have a lot of stuff working there and some of them like the guy with the short cropped hair and 3 day beard and the girl with the curly hair are actually super nice and very helpful. Unfortunately they are in the minority as the rest of the staff can simply not be bothered to do anything. If you arrive and want to check and you see the tall guy with the dread locks working you might as well just walk out backwards and just wait until there is someone else at the desk. If you are not a young girl he will most likely go out of his way to completely ignore you to the point that you are standing right in front of him while he flat out looks right through you. I would give this place a zero rating for their stuff but because there were two very helpful and nice people I'll give the hostel one point for the service.The cleaners who come in the morning are very fast and efficient and the hostel is clean during the day. But as they leave after they are done with the morning clean the hostel gets quite dirty and the bathrooms and showers look like you are on a campsite or rock festival by the end of the day.I really like the fact that they don't have an age restriction! SO seeing a lot of older men in their 50-60s was actually a positive thing - until I found out that most of them seem to be staying there long term and drinking way too much. When I was checking in there were two girls complaining about one of the old men being rude, aggressive and threatening other travelers in the room. The tall guy with the dread locks didn't seem to care at all but as they were girls he at least graced them with his attention and suggested they'd go out and party with him that night. On two of the three nights other people had issues with some of the older man staying there and I overheard some of them complaining about it to the staff. One of them said he could pass the information on to the manager.When I was checking out in the morning an old man in his late 50s or early 60s from the UK woke up the entire dorm by threatening a young Asian backpacker. The old man was so drunk and confrontational that it was hard for anyone to understand him. When I checked out shortly after I told the front desk and the night shift guy who was one of the two good employees said that he had heard about these complaints already but that all he can do is pass the information on to the manager.During my stay I got to talk to quite a lot of backpackers from all over the world and from different backgrounds and we kept wondering why this place gets such high ratings....As this is a party hostel it seems to help to be drunk and night and passed out during the day to enjoy this place. As with most party hostels they fall short on all the basic things that make a good hostel because their main party crowd will leave a good comment based on their pub tours and how drunk they got and not on the actual hostel and its service and facilities.Security: The hostel is located in a backyard and the yard is locked with an iron gate / iron door. If you ring the buzzer they will let you into the yard. But the people who live in the front of the building also go in and out and if you buzz the hostel they will let you in anyways because they don't know all their customers' faces or if the person is just checking in. Often times people would also leave the whole gate open. At the hostel itself you will get an electronic keychain to unlock the door to your dorm upstairs. Usually a pretty safe setup but it defeats the purpose of having such a system if the windows right next to the door are always open! People forget their keychains and they leave the windows open to get some fresh air or to smoke or to put their wet clothes on the window to dry. So you can see people climbing in and out of the windows. They do have lockers in the rooms but they are way too small to fit a regular sized backpackers main backpack inside.Oh yeah, if you book the more expensive dorm room with the ensuite bathroom do not expect to have a toilet because all you'll get is the shower. This saves you the 5 meter walk to the shower area but will not help you at all when you want to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.And on the off chance that anyone from the higher management actually reads this:Although the older men that were staying there long term were a big problem I hope that Hostel Mostel will not impose an age restriction! It would have been much less of a problem if the staff would have taken care of the problem from the very beginning.",Good location but extremely bad service and low level of security!,6B6F42D016ADE1CA5348607604169E13

Bran (and the other people who work there) is a really friendly and helpful guy. The Hostel has a relaxed style and super chilled out common area. We had a private room which was on the street side of the hostel. The rooms are huge and set into a heavy concrete building which makes them cool and quiet. The street facing side can be a little noisy due to the large intersection and trams but the rooms have double glazed windows which help a lot. It just means you can't sleep with the windows open.We were able to book a Rila Monastery tour through at reception. No so much of a tour as a couple of blokes who drove us to the monastery and back and a semi guided tour to the cave. It was really good value anyhow so it was no problem.Bran also accommodated our request (at a reasonable price) for a little extra time to sleep before our late night train which was really nice.The food is really basic but decent. Breakfast was best with a selection of meats, cheeses, dressings and eggs plus bread and toppings. There is plenty of coffee and tea and the place is clean and tidy.

There was no coffee maker in the room - we could have used one. Ms. Maya Pashpurova at the hotel planned many day tours for us: she was very helpful and professional.",Had a Pleasant Stay,44CDDDCEF53A3564FB5E3092727D126C

review_623254960,2018-10-08,42.693035,23.318521,Rosslyn Thracia Hotel,40,"We stayed here in a double for 2 nights (were booked for 5, but checked out early to move to another hotel). The pros: the hotel is located in a convenient location very close to Vitosha Blvd - a pedestrian street (in this area) that is filled with restaurants and shops, and is also close enough to walk to most of the major sights. Breakfast is included, but I consider this a pro and a con as there were few choices that I would consider palatable (bread and cereal were about it - there were tomato slices with melted cheese, beans, and white rice?) The negatives: the staff don't care about you or your problems - although I should qualify that this seems to be the prevailing attitude of everyone in Sofia, so perhaps I shouldn't hold that against the hotel too much as it seems to be rampant. The room was about 30 degrees (over 85) and we could only get hot air out of the vent no matter how we set it - after speaking to the front desk, apparently they control whether the ""central system"" is set to cool or heat, and they had decided it should be heat, so it was heat. His suggestion, open the window. Well, it's 75 outside, so that's not helpful, especially since only one of the 3 windows opens, and it only opens 3 inches. After sweating through 2 nights, we found a hotel that lets its guests control their own comfort and moved there. We also had the housekeeper decide on her own to remove the keycard we had left in the slot by the door that allows you to run the lights - this had let us charge our electronics. She not only removed it from the slot, she removed it from the room completely, so we had to go down to the friendly desk clerk and get a new one. The beds are OK, the decor is fine, a bit older but not bad. We did have one bug, but that was likely due to the open window. Otherwise it was clean. Would I recommend it? If you don't mind the heat, sure. I can imagine that when the management decides it should be cold, it will also get too cold for some, but if you are ok with temperature extremes in either direction, then it is conveniently located. However, I have respiratory issues, so heat is not great for me and neither is an open window when everyone in town smokes. So, I would have to say no to this hotel (and Sofia in general) again.","Room stifling, staff uncaring",FC65E62D5AD8598E0E0F253593731651
review_621677656,2018-10-02,42.693035,23.318521,Rosslyn Thracia Hotel,40,"Rosslyn Tracia Hotel is a typical city hotel covering the basic needs of a business traveler. I would say that it feels more that a 3+ rather than a 4* venue. With a good value for money it is the location that makes a difference here. Situated in the very heart of Sofia you can go easily out and about on foot after a busy day. Breakfast is adequate and of good quality and everything is fresh. Rooms look classy and spotless clean. I didn't try the restaurant -not sure if there is, so I don't have any opinion on their cooking skills. Subject to availability insist on booking a double for single's use even if you re a solo traveler to get a more spacious and comfortable room.

Breakfast was pretty good but they only had a small amount of brown bread day one, no brown day 2, and ran out of bread altogether on day 3!Our problem with this hotel was that there was no blind or curtain at a velux window in our bedroom. This is perfect for a 4am start if you want one but less good if you want a decent night's sleep. There were 4 of us sharing a suite which ought to have been luxurious but with no blind at a window over two of the beds, the hotel really let us down. We spoke to 4 staff over 3 days and were only given some paper to stick onto the window which was completely ineffective. There were so many excuses about holidays and being short staffed but a hotel's priority needs to be to ensure everything possible is done to give a guest a good night's sleep. There was another room in our suite that was locked and we asked if it was another bedroom that might be used but we were told it was broken. Quite what that meant I don't know.There was no offer to move rooms, no effort to fix a blind or curtain was made and no compensation was given either. Disappointing. I didn't score lower because everything else was very good.The photos show our attempts to cover the window and the hotel's paper bag effort which stayed up for about 3 minutes!",Mostly great but no blind at the window?,45A98D8EE2E271F914DB7D8A8A15C143

The bed was maybe a bit too soft and the absence of a safe in the room was a shame.As other reviewers have said, the breakfast is not amazing, but I found it more than adequate, and if you do not want breakfast at the hotel, you can walk to Vitosha Boulevard in 2 minutes for many good food options.One final note, parking around the hotel is very limited or impossible, so this is not the best option if you are coming by car. For public transport it is good though, Metro stations are close by, at either end of Vitosha Boulevard.

The lobby is not impressive, but this is a modern hotel with large, spotless rooms including a small kitchenette, seats, large shower and a balcony. It's all you can ask for and much more !Strangely enough, the breakfast area is not at all in line with the modernity of the hotel. The young lady that runs the place is friendly, upbeat and english spoken, but please provide her with modern stuff to work with.Some details? here you go:1) the buffet is placed on some different, old tables that look like they can collapse at any moment. 2) there's one (!) old, little toaster present that you would not even get rid of in a garage sale 3) choice of bread is limited to all weat or white. The white slices are too large for the toaster, you have to tear a piece off to make them fit. 4) no bread rolls, buns or croissants or whatever variety. 5) orange juice not fresh, tastes cheap, served in an old plastic beaker 6) yogurt can be scooped from a plate into...what? there are no bowls present, so eat it from another flat plate. 7) the stag of plates consists of all different types and sizes. 8) the sugar bowl looks like a children's toy. 9) why is a stag of plastic chairs stored next to the buffet all the time? 10) why is there no door between the breakfast area and the restroom area ??The ""Smugglars diner"" breakfast room is meant to resemble an all American diner, with all kinds of Americana on the walls, but due to these strange shortcomings and the presence of a couple of rather grumpy elderly ladies, it rather resembles the former USSR.I want to end on a positive note though.... the breakfast as such is not so bad, but the set-up is unprofessional, hence I deduct one star from my rating. That leaves 4 stars that are very well deserved.

Bed was super comfortable, lovely balcony, beautiful bath in the middle of the bathroom.I have to say receptionist had fallen from out of space. My friend’s husband booked the room for us as a treat and the girl I guess did not understand how the system works since she kept asking who we were and why the person who booked it was not there. Funny thing when we finally got to the room upon turning on the TV it said ‘Welcome and my friend’s name’ came up right away (not her husband’s). Well at least the TV knew who was staying there. If that was not enough when we were leaving we were asked to pay for the room again even though it was paid for at reservation (a month ago). Seems like there might have been an issue with the system. This kind of thing happen and it would have been ok really. Except for the 10-15 min while we waited for them to figure it out - we were examined like theives. We were asked to pay on two instanses like we didn’t just mention it was already paid and all encounters with the reception staff were robot like and truely unpleasant. Oh I have to mention one of the people on the reception was the floor manager who made no effort of checking the system herself but instead had a robot conversation about last night’s unwelcoming arrival. Funny thing is she didn’t seem to care really - why bother mentioning it then when it just makes us feel even more uncomfortable.Sounds like you should never book a room for someone else or allow someone else to book a room for you at The Intercontinental in Sofia. Oh and don’t forget to pay on the spot to make it easier for them.

review_631778368,2018-11-07,42.693623,23.332308,InterContinental Sofia,100,Stayed two nights recently in this revamped establishment now with the IHG brand.Not a luxury hotel but a true four stars with all what you may expect as a business traveller with a great location. Nice and comfortable room with a good bathroom and lighting. Lovely Club Lounge but maybe soon to small with the success knocking on the door of no doubt newest and already best hotel in the City.Nice staff with few very good old timers and lot of young ones well selected. Among them a Bell Boy/driver by the name of Alexander that for sure will have a great acting career in a not to distant future due to his interest in the world of cinema as student but as well is sharp views and ambition to discover the world from is just 18 years. Good and warm bar atmosphere as well and next door even if not deserved by the hotel a quiet friendly restaurant of Asian cuisine that was not bad at all.It was nice to discover such a young but well manage establishment of a very human dimension.A nice new place to stay in Sofia.,New & Good,02B8D7A1CDDAC768082E8B9521334A4F

I always preferred this hotel in my business trips if available so far over the last 4 years. I have a very high frequency of stay. So far my experience was good. However, as I write this review, I am up at 1:47 and housekeeping is in my room to change bed sheets because my bed is fully covered with bugs (fleas). The moment I realized, I called the front desk. It took me approx 10 mins to convince the front desk manager that there are bugs everywhere in the bed and someone should attend the room. (I guess he thought I was hallucinating or dreaming). Then the housekeeping lady cam started changing the sheets. I called the front desk once more telling that I would like to change my room. I am told that bugs came from outside, its normal and I should be able to sleepnin this room. Hotel is in the midst of the city, windows are not opening, building is fully glass, and there is no way that these bugs would survive in this environment - they are fleas or bedbugs clearly, I know a bit about insects. Irrespective of this, I hate bugs, I am payin 200€+ per night, I have a right to sleepnin a clean bed. Apparently front desk staff do not think so, neither does the hotel. I am sharing screnshots from the video I took, in case hotel disputes over my feedback. If need be I can also share the video itself, yet app does not allow that. stay away from this rude, terrible, dirty hotel and its miserable staff...","Terrible experience, disgusting!",801B821972C39B9F543C6D6B698FDBD1

Canape Connection is not your typical hostel in that it does not have a traditional reception etc. Instead, you are personally welcomed. It is very small in that it has just a handful of rooms, but my room itself was huge, had good storage, a heater and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom and kitchen facilities were also clean and tidy.Location-wise, it is 2-3 minutes walk off Vitosha Boulevard. I walked the city from this base and it was no bother. Sofia has a large public transport network, too.As is the norm in Bulgaria, I was asked to pay in cash on arrival. This my seem a little strange to anyone from a country where contactless cards have become the norm, but it isn't in Sofia.I received some recommendations from my host and all of these turned out to be good, too.All in all, I'd thoroughly recommend this hostel.",Perfect place to stay for the solo traveler,C72871548BAAC5568E60A8DCE02B1003

In the attic there is a dorm room with about 4 single beds and 1 double.I really enjoyed our stay there. It was clean. Very close to the city centre too. A 2 minute walk took you to some food shops!

First, i was charged upfront(blocked the money in my account) for my stay but double the amount. When asked why, they said in case i buy something during stay. They gave me the option to pay the correct amount on the first day!! As if!! I complained about a/c because its was blowing cold air (outside it was -5). After several calls to the reception they said they would send someone to fix it. After an hour they gave me a hot air portable machine!!!In the price, the airport shuttle to and from the hotel was included. I booked a month before my stay and i forgot that. Nobody notify me on the day of my arrival. I asked for the shuttle for the transportation to the airport and they said is 5 euro. I asked why.

Hotel offers shuttle, which we would have used if we knew.The City hotel is not in the city centre, but it does not take long to go there by tram, by foot or taxi. You are a few minutes from the Nevski cathedral. There are a few takeaways, kiosks and 2 cafees near the hotel.The hotel has 2 wings, A+B. Small lobby area with lobbybar, sitting area outside. Ground floor offers meeting facilities, business centre (PC and printer) and Italian restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. No bellboy service.Allthough requesting a high floor We were located in the B-wing on the 1st floor. Good size room, carpeted, comfy doublebed, clean linnen, Sat.TV, minibar, safe, coffee/tea&kettle. Even the aircon was off, cold air was coming out which made me freeze during the night. (extra downs provided). Bathroom of good sized, Tub was really tall and not easy to get in and out if you are an older person. Waterpressure a bit wobbly. Lights at the mirror could be improved. Room cleaned everyday, cleaning staff seemed friendly, but shouting in the corridors and slamming doors when trying to rest.Wifi worked fine everywhere, and the hotel was clean.Breakfast served from 7am with cold and hot items, all fresh and well prepared. Unfortunately the coffee is not good and 1 machine is not enough when the place is busy. We had a few dinners in the restaurant, all fresh and well prepared. Prices high scale, but still prices in Sofia are quite reasonable. As a diamond client we had 10% off the restaurant bill. Some days we were able to add the bill on the room, some days not!? One evening there were a private party in the restaurant, which meant that we could not use the courtyard or the restaurant, but we could hear the loud music until midnight in our rooms.

After a while a chap who'd been eating and watching tv and we'd taken for a guest got up and started clearing plates. At no time did he say hello, check if we were ok or even look at us or any of the other guests. This rudeness is at complete odds with the friendly emails I received before the visit and even after thanking us for leaving the room tidy! A great shame.

The room I has was huge and spotless clean.Beds are very very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious with good quality aminities.So room wise and quality of sleep wise of a very good 4* quality.The big disappointment came when I went down for a meal. The menu looks ok but as I also wanted to try our their kitchen I ordered a chicken soup and a spaghetti bolognese. Not the most complex dishes one would think but both where of a low quality. Tasteless and really sloppy kitchen work. Never had to use so much salt and pepper to make both dishes at least a bit tasty.The average airport food is top class compared to the quality delivered by this restaurant.Also the breakfast was not that fantastic and compared to may other 4* hotels I stayed below standard.Dishes were not replenished in time, only margarine was available on both days. Upon request I got butter delivered but visible it was not standard on their list of available food for breakfast.Service overall was friendly I have to say. Check-out was also swift and friendly.Room wise really a nice hotel but the food supplied is far, far away of 4* level. Really a pity as with a good kitchen it could be one of the better hotels in Sofia.Luckily closeby is a very nice Italian restaurant at the Maleeva tenis courts in a short walking distance.Unfortunately I will go back to our initial hotel, even though not as conveniently located as this one but food wise much better.Although further from the office.","Nice hotel, disappointing food",18D6A861DB3B5925F5ADA88987123AC1

review_610657305,2018-08-26,42.666267,23.327608,Maison Sofia Hotel,20,"At first we were so excited when we arrived at the hotel. The people were really nice and helpful and the room looked just fine. Once we settled in tho it was a whole other story.The room was in poor condition. They tried to hide that the room was old but you could see the wall paper in places tearing off the wall or some spots on the carpet. The quality of the bed sheets were obviously poor but specifically one of the covers was teared apart at the edge, and of course the “great” surprise realizing that the little shampoos and conditioners in the bathroom were already used slightly and not replaced. Really we couldn’t feel comfortable at all. Even when they cleaned the room again the next day it was just frustrating. They came by around 16.00 it took 30 mins and when we got back to the room they have left the clean towels on the luggage on the floor and again not replace the shampoo or the bed sheet after it was pointed out to them.The food tho was the biggest disappointment of all! The first day we decided to have breakfast in bed since its one of the services the hotel provides. The croissants were horrible, hard like rocks from the day before, and same goes for the bread. We ordered coffee and they brought some tiny shots of espresso (best guess, can’t know for sure what that thing was) with the most horribly testing coffee. The eggs were just ok but honestly after testing everything else our appetite was gone. The next day we had breakfast at the restaurant and things were somewhat better although still very basic and poor missing basic things like cream for the coffee. I strongly advice to stay away from that thing they call coffee it was horrible each time (even the regular black coffee).The night after we had dinner at the restaurant since we were exhausted and again everything was horrible. From the long wait for our courses (>30mins) to the untrained staff bringing first the main course and the appetizer and finally 30 mins after when we are almost done the salad. Honestly so bad tasting and poorly made! Everything tasted like it came from a can and there are no words to describe the pasta! It was the most expensive and at the same time awful dinner we had in Sofia!!Honestly a very bad experience and a complete waste of money given that even the location is far from the center and the closest subway station is a 20min walk.",Everything about it was awful,F00E8D3D2ECAD151FC798CC072BBB9D5

Check-in was swift and friendly, front office was always helpful, rooms were spacious and clean, location is fair (close to the city). Yet, missing the breakfast by 5 minutes triggered the most upsetting moment. We were humiliated in front of other guests for not making it on time, and although we finally managed to get a cup of coffee and some pastry, they were handed over to us in such an IMPOLITE and HOSTILE manner that the otherwise spotless Bulgarian hospitality (and the industry built upon it) would be deeply ashamed. Such behavior is incompatible with any standards, let alone those of a three-star Best Western.
