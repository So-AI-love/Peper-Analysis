The pictures do it great justice, as it really is that nice. Beautifully decorated and very clean. The flat has everything you'd need, including some toiletries such as shower gel which is very helpful if you're hand luggage only. Couldn't get a better location in Sofia, so close to everything you might want to do and surrounded by some great restaurants (give The Little Things a go, it's right behind the apartment!).\n\nThe church opposite is beautiful and great to look out over, just know that they like to give their bells a good ring in the morning at 8am on Saturday and 9am Sunday whilst we were there. So if you'd like to sleep in, you should know to expect these to last for a couple of minutes - but why would you want to sleep in when in Sofia?\n\nAlso, the apartment is on the fifth floor and there is no elevator.

For the two of us it was absolutely perfect. \r\n\r\nAs has been said, it was up 5 flights of stairs and so it's quite hard work each time you return to the flat. With suitcases it's also rather hard. Don't be put off by the outside front door, it has lots of graffiti on it, however we discovered that graffiti is very normal in Sofia, it's everywhere! \r\n\r\nThe flat is clean, tidy, has everything you can need and is secure. There is an extra large bolt for security which was nice. The air conditioner is also a heater, which was needed on some days. \r\n\r\nWe had some difficulties organising getting the keys as we arrived on a weekday and Ina who was due to get us the keys was working till 5:30pm. Thankfully the day before she let us know that she would be able to meet us at the flat when we arrived, which was much better. \r\n\r\nThe location is perfect we were 10 mins from the centre of town, many good restaurants directly around us, including the amazing 'The Little Things' which is literally directly below the flat and a gorgeous crepe shop for dessert. Never met any of the neighbours so that was no problem, the church outside rings out it's bells every morning at 8am sharp, no need to set an alarm as it woke us gently each morning. \r\n\r\nPrice is incredible for what you get, would highly recommend."", ""although we arrived very late everything went perfectly. the flat is super comfy and has all you need. very good located."", ""The apartment was great! We loved the apartment itself, the view from the apartment and the location. If you are lucky enough and have the option to stay here I would definitely recommend it! My sister and I spent 4 nights in the apartment and we loved it! The apartment is modern and has great light. It is located right above a beautiful square with a church and has the best view. It is important to note that the apartment is almost on the top floor and it is quite a climb to get up to the apartment so I would not recommend this for anyone who has an issue with stairs. My sister and I enjoyed the exercise and welcomed the climb after spending our days trying all the delicious bulgarian food. We loved the crepe place and The Little Things restaurant right under the apartment and we also enjoyed the pizza at Mama Mia. The location of the apartment could not have been better and we were able to walk everywhere in the city. Lucho and Ina were amazing hosts and were welcoming and super helpful. We fell in love with Sofia and this amazing apartment just made our stay even better. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone planning a trip to Sofia!"", ""Awesome apartment!

Higly recommend!"", ""The home is very nice,and The ubication too!!"", ""Our stay at Luchesar's apartment was mostly lovely, if hindered by a few things. \n\nWe arrived in Sofia around 2pm, which was the stated check in time, with the knowledge that we wouldn't be able to get into the flat until 5pm. Throughout the day this time was gradually pushed back till 6pm, and once in the flat we had to wait around for another hour whilst the host's friend cleaned the flat after the previous guest had stayed. \n\nThe flat itself was lovely, very comfortable and a great size for 2 people, would also accommodate 4 rather easily. The view, being on the 5th floor, is wonderful! The church square opposite the building is lovely and quite popular for obvious reasons. \n\nThe washroom seemed to be slightly smelly, the drains seem to be connected and so the shower did not smell particularly clean. \n\nOtherwise, our trip was lovely. Can recommend for others to stay, just make sure to have your notifications switched on the day you're checking in."", ""We had a lovely stay at Luchesar's apartment on Sishman Street. The apartment is as in the photos, with a great view, light feel and modern decor. The building and area was very quiet, despite being in the centre of town, which we loved, and we were able to sleep with the windows open with no noise. Sofia is a quiet city, right now, and there was never more than a gentle hubbub from the cafe in the square below, during the day. We ate at a few cafes nearby, many of which are brilliant,  and low cost compared to most European cities. A special mention to Skapto Burger just up the road, and the amazing ice cream shop not much further on.  We had coffee and crepes one morning for breakfast from the place at the Base of our building. We have only two words of Bulgarian, but most people either spoke perfect English or pointing worked fine. The kitchen in the apartment was well equipped and we put together a couple of great meals from Bulgarian fayre, bought from within 100m of the front door. We took a couple of the free tours, including 'Balkan Bites' which gave us a taster of the local food. Sofia may be a bit rough around the edges, but the food and people are world class. \nThe apartment was a home from home, and despite the 5 flights of stairs, was the perfect place to be.

The only concern in the beginning was that the  area is quite dark at night, so I wasn't sure about how safe it is...but I had no problem and apparently the Sofia is quite safe city in general. Mila was very quick at responding the messages and very helpful with my requests. Recommend the place if you wanna spend a few days in Sofia. \nXx"", ""Great Airbnb in Sofia. Mila was very attentive throughout the whole process and I was even able to do a late check-in without any issues. The apartment was clean, spacious, and in a convenient location.

This made finding the place, finding parking, and figuring out the key system a little difficult. I feel like Airbnb is a community of individuals helping each other out (a little extra cash for the one and a cheap, non commercial, place to stay for the other) and when the host isn't there I always suspect that some mafia boss is just renting out dozens of flats with made up profiles. Still good place for the money. Kind of a strange, if not very clean area, but the flat itself was very clean, not far from the main attractions, and had parking on site--although this isnt guaranteed, just depends on if there is a free spot, which bothered me a little. My overall rating for the place is positive but if I stayed in Sofia again I would probably look elsewhere. That being said, Mila (if that's your real name;)) was very communicative, friendly and helpful."", ""The flat is nice and located at a walkable distance to the main attractions. The wifi could be a bit better, since it disconnected all the time from my phone when I was out of the bedroom.\nThe city is very hot during the summer and an air conditioning would make the stay more pleasant."", ""Mila's apartment is very nice just like the pictures. It's very easy to get there by metro. And it's very safe area cause the police station is few steps far from the apartment :) There's a shopping mall near the apartment where you can find something to eat. Also there's a currency exchange in the mall, the exchange rate there is better than airport and city center."", ""Very clean and nice appartment"", ""The bed is really awesome and the mattress is really comfy!\nThe apartment is in a quiet area but not far from the main road and just a five minute walk from the city centre (the area where the most hip places are) - we have enjoyed the walks back home in the night!\nMila had some water put away in the fridge - it was 35\u00b0C - we really appreciated it!

Thanks again! Veronika and Balazs"", ""We had a wonderful stay. We enjoyed having coffee on the quiet balcony in the morning. The full-sized fridge was a pleasant surprise, as we like to buy a few groceries for breakfast. Even with the windows open at night, the area was quiet enough to sleep.

The studio is exactly as described, small but very functional, situated in probably the nicest neighbourhood of Sofia. You have everything you need and there is also a big supermarket nearby and a dm-store opposite the metro station. The centre is also very easy to reach by the metro, only two stations away. Boris lives in the same building , so you can find him if you need something, but this would rarely be the case. The wifi connection was excellent, I had no problem at all with the internet.

Buy a ticket for 1 Lev at the window and get onto the metro going toward Center, which is actually the third stop called Serdica or Serdika.\r\n\r\nThe first stop from Joliot Curie is Stadium. Continue on to the second stop, Sofia University. Step off the train there and go up the escalator to the right. Pass through the turnstiles and immediately begin looking for McDonald\u2019s *before* you go out of the underground. Directly across from McD is the Tourist Information Center. They have a website with hours listed at (Website hidden by Airbnb) Inside the information center you will find maps, guides, and people who speak English and can answer all your questions as well as make good recommendations. Then from the info center it is a comfortable, scenic walk into the city center. Now, please enjoy your stay.

"", ""This is my second time in Maia's place. The apartment is really nice and its location is just great. There's a lot to see if you want to take a walk around the center of the city and the metro station is just a couple of minutes away for everything else. \nMaia is also a great host and will offer you help should you need something. \n\nI highly recommend this place and will probably stay there again in future!"", ""A quiet apartment at the heart of a busy city.\n"", ""The place is really nice and the location is perfect - right in the center of the city.  The metro station is just a couple minutes away and there's also a bus stop almost at the front door. \nMaia and her sister were also very nice and helpful."", ""Great place. Small but well arranged, located close to everything. It faces a quiet (surprisingly quiet!) back yard. It's a great deal!"", ""Maia's apartment is really cosy and nice, for me looks as well artistic. The apartment has everything, from well equipped kitchen to a washing machine, WiFi-TV, comfortable bed and nice couch to rest during the day.  The apartment is looks like as it in the pictures, I could say even bigger. The only thing is that the Toilet is small, but for me was totally okay- no need of big toilets with a lot of space that is not used- This was perfect small to do the ordinary things...\r\n\r\nThe apartment is located in the top center, everything what you want is on a walking distance- around you have restaurants, cafes, 24 hour shops, parks and the main attractive places in the city are on a walking distance. \r\n\r\nMaya is really nice, she was sending me massages during my stay to ask if everything is okay and fine or if we need something... the host that you really want :))\r\n\r\nI recommend this place for friends, couple or a family... it really worth it.\r\n \r\n"", ""Perfect central location, tricky if you have a car and don't know the regulations for public parking. Thank you!"", ""very sweet host. a really girl-next-door character that received us with kindness and was always a few seconds away from a reply on a text msg. apt is cute. bathroom smaller than small but the good thing is that the whole place is warm, and everything u might need in a home is there. i would definitely recommend her. p.s. the apt is downtown in the best possible location."", ""I rented the apartment for my son and he told me that Mia was very easy to contact and a really nice person.  He agreed with all the reviews written above however wanted to emphasize on the size of the bathroom , it is really small. "", ""This is the second time we stayed at Maia's place. Just like the last time she was a great host - although we did not need to contact her very often, she was very quick to respond, flexible and very easy to communicate with. \r\n\r\nAs for the place - it is exactly how it looks like in the pictures - it is even more cozy with the new couch :))\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend staying there if you are visiting Sofia and you are looking for a nice, comfortable and a convenient place to stay at which is at a perfect location as well. \r\n\r\nWe wish you all the best, Maia - we hope to see you again. :) "", ""My boyfriend and I stayed at Maia's apartment for 2 whole months. I am a local, so I pretty much know Sofia like the back of my hand, but it was my boyfriend's first time here. The most awesome thing is that the apartment is close to everything you might want to see in the downtown area. Also it is close to a major bus and underground stop to take you anywhere else in the city. Most of the tourist sites are no more than 20-ish minutes on foot (at most) and you can walk everywhere. There is no chance for you to get lost mainly because it is in a super easy to find location. It is very close to most of the bars and restaurants, but if that is not really your cup of tea - there is a park nearby, too. Another plus is that the apartment is on the quiet side of the building so your rest is guaranteed. The apartment itself looks exactly like in the pictures, it is very cute and has everything you might need. Although we did not have to interact a lot with Maia, she is very helpful and we had nothing but positive experience with her. We are both super happy we chose that place and highly recommend it for your stay! \r\nP.S.: And a special huge thanks to Maia for being a super cool host! :)"", ""I don't really what to say except that everything went perfectly well and that I enjoyed staying at Maia's flat.\r\nAh yes, something more: Maia was really friendly and nice."", ""Maia's place was compact and very convenient. Although some of the convenience was taken away as I had to climb up to the 6th floor due to elevator issues, the location itself was great.\n\nThe room is equipped with everything you would need during a travel and Maia was kind enough to explain everything to me."", ""The flat was a good location, within walking distance to everything and near the metro if needed. It was great value and simple but very clean."", ""We were warmly welcomed by Elizabeth, Maia\u2019s Co host, who has been really flexible with our arrival time. The accommodation is well located: just 10 minutes walking to the centre of Sofia and 5 minutes walking to the metro station, which is connected with the airport. The apartment is clean, has one big bedroom and one big living room with a kitchen, which is fully equipped. The bathroom is quite small, there is a little space to take a shower, but for a couple of days it\u2019s been fine. I recommend it to all travellers!"", ""Maia has been a wonderful, thoughtful and responsive host. We had a problem that she willingly and quickly solved - because of the annual reconstruction of the water supply system there was a lack of hot water but instead of making excuses, Maia installed a boiler in no time.  Her apartment is cozy and even though it is on a busy central boulevard, it is quiet, full of light and it has everything one may need."", ""Nice apartment in central location for a good price. I definitely recommend it to other travelers! We were welcomed warmly and had a great time."", ""the flat is very nice and well located. the kitchen is small but very functional and the room has a lot of storage places. I would recommand it. "", ""Maia is a great host and apartment had everything we needed for a few nights stay in Sofia, highly recommended!"", ""We loved the location of the apartment, outstanding hospitality at a great value."", ""Lovely clean apartment close to city centre. Check in and out was flawless. Will stay again. "", ""Maia was at all times availbale for questions and had great recommendations. The location of the flat was very nice, quiet, yet close to the city center. Unfortunately, one out of two windows in the sleeping room did not have any blinds and the other two were ineffective. If you are light sensible when sleeping, that is quite unpleasant. The bathroom is like in the pictures, tiny. The living room and kitchen were great though, comfortable and spacious to hang out. If you are there for a stop over, it\u00b4s a great value price combination. "", ""location is great"", ""This is a lovely and cutely small apartment. We stayed here for three nights only but we enjoyed every bit of it. The bed was a tad small for us (but we are a bunch of tall Dutch giants) so for the most people it should be fine. Elevator up to the sixth floor is quite rusty and scary but it does it's job well. Elie was flexible with our arrival, allthough we had some communicational problems, she was there in the end with a big smile! The location could not be better, close to the most diverse kinds of public transport and within walking distance of nearly all attractions. This apartment surely was an amazing start of our holiday, thanks to Maia and Elie!"", ""Maja's appartment is perfect! The place was extremely comfortable, quiet,clean, with equipped kitchen, nice living room, TV and comfortable bed. Very well location close to tram and bus, few minutes walking from a metro station (direct line from/to the airport) and close to the city center. Eli is a great host, very friendly and responsive to every kind of question.\nRecommended!"", ""Nice, cosy flat with the perfect location - anything in the centre is within comfortable walking distance and the metro is only a few minutes away. The flat itself has everything you need - I spent close to two months living here comfortably.

Cosy, clean and perfect to spend few days in sofia"", ""The studio was great for my husband and I. Spacious for the two of us, it\u2019s clean and it has everything we needed. Yes, the bathroom was a bit cramp but manageable. What\u2019s important - it was very clean and the shower water pressure was good. Wifi speed was fast.\n\nIt\u2019s a 5-minute walk to the metro station and the tram stop. Ellie who met us on behalf, gave us tips on the shops and the places we could go to. Unfortunately, the lift was still under repair when we were there. Otherwise, it was perfect for two. Maia was kind to let us check-in earlier after our 15 hours journey."", ""I had an excellent stay at the flat. It's about as central as you want. Excellent space, and remained pretty warm even though I came during a crazy cold snap.\n\nOne problem I had was that the lift was broken down while I was there, so I had to take the stairs for 6 floors while I was there. Hopefully it's fixed by now!"", ""After travelling for months Maia's apartments was the right place for me to have some rest. I spent there two weeks feeling really like at home! Perfect Central location with everything around in a walking distance and at the same time there is no noise at all. Lovely bedroom with lots of storage space and comfortable mattress. Fully equipped Kitchenet and washing machine. The bathroom is small but sparkling clean. And last but not least - Maia is the perfect host - friendly and always responding immediately to all my messages and requests. I'll be very happy to book again when next time in Sofia. Recommending to everyone!!!"", ""Really loved my stay In Maya's apartament.Everything was clean and really cosy.Very close to the Metro and bus station and the center of the city.Eli was really kind and friendly,responding to all of my questions with a lot of patience.Thank you so much!I will not hesitate taking that one again if coming back to Sofia."", ""This is the perfect home for those wanting a cosy inviting space to enjoy Sofia. Close to everything needed in the city and the tourist spots but tucked away in a residential area. Maia is welcoming, great with communication and easy to contact. We loved our stay so much!"", ""This is our second time staying in Maia's apartment. It was truly a pleasure having a home to come back to with all the facilities you need  for a home away from home that is close to all amenities, transport and  eateries. Thank you so much once again for an amazing stay!"", ""It\u2019s small, but it has everything. Very cosy atmosphere!"", ""The place was very easy to reach from the airport and close to nice cafes, restaurants, bars (see Maia's recommendations) and sights. Communication and welcoming was top level."", ""Maia's apartment is in an excellent location in Sofia. It is perfect for a couple traveling to the city. We stayed for four nights. I would highly recommend this apartment for short or long trips!"", ""Maia's accommodation is in a great location to visit the city. For two people the apartment is very spacious, comfortable and equipped with all the amenities and comforts needed for a great vacation. The bathroom is a bit small but still clean and functional. Great value for money, definitely recommended."", ""The location is very convenient and the house is very cosy with a great view. The only problem is that if you are not able to walk up 6 floors, the elevator is old and just for one person. Lastly the bathroom is quite small yet full functional! Maia was very friendly and helpful making us feel comfortable from the very beginning!"", ""It was a pleasure to stay at Maia's house! The house is extremely clean and prettily decorated. The bed is a little small as claimed by other reviewers but my wife and I had no problem sleeping on the cosy bed. The location is great too and Maia was extremely helpful with a early morning check in and with her recommendations.\n\nThe limited bathroom space may be a problem for some people but we could manage it!\n\nWe are going to stay again at Maia's for our onward journey too!"", ""We enjoyed our stay at Maia's place! Maia was in communication with us about arriving and was easy to set up a checkin time with. She met us outside and took us up to the apartment (6 floors up - there is a lift that carries one person at a time). The apartment is on the smaller side, with a very small kitchen and extremely small bathroom. The kitchen has almost no counter space, so be prepared if you're planning on cooking your meals. However, when we needed a larger pot for cooking food, Maia was extremely kind to purchase one for our use! The bathroom is a wet shower, hot water wasn't a problem, but the toilet was uncomfortable, as you had to sit on it sideways. The living space was large with a comfortable couch and everything was bright and airy. The bedroom has a ton of storage space, and as some have mentioned the bed was small, it worked find for us (it was an American full size mattress). \n\nMaia touched base with us during our stay to make sure everything was okay. So communication was great to begin with, however amenities on the listing were not available/included (breakfast and shampoo), and when we brought it up, we only got an apology, not a solution. We weren't upset and just wanted to find a solution, but when we offered one, we unfortunately never heard back form Maia. We're sorry it ended like this, as the apartment was in a great location in city center Sofia and we really enjoyed our time there!"", ""Clean apartment with excellent facilities. Location is fantastic because you can walk to almost any location and it is easy to get to from the airport by public transport. The bed is not as big as a double but for sure is enough for two people. \nMaia gave us advice on places to visit at the start and was a constant source of useful information throughout our trip. Highly recommend"", ""Maia's place is very central. You can visit everything by foot. Clean and cozy. Maia's is very helpful. We've checked in around 22:30pm and looks like was not a problem for her, she was very smiling and giving us tips !\nThe only \""bad\"" thing is the bed, definitely too small for 2.\nOtherwise I really recommend this place !

Maia was excellent with communication. Thank you!"", ""We had a lovely stay here. The apartment is located in the center of Sofia. You can visit most things on foot. It is a small space, but there is everything you could need with a cosy and comfortable living room. The bathroom is quite small with a shower head next to the toilet, but we also saw this in other places so maybe it is a common thing. It didn't bother us. The bed might be a bit narrow for two people, especially if you aren't a couple. We were received very warmly by a friend of Maia. We are happy with our stay here, we couldn't wish for more!"", ""Great location, everything you need and lots of space for storage"", ""Great flat, very light and spacious. Bathroom is very small (you have to shower over the toilet) but other than that it's perfect. Would come again."", ""Great clear hosts. Thanks for the stay! I recommend the place and hosts to everyone that travels to Sofia! "", ""It was my second time.. and there will be many more for sure !"", ""Apartment is in a great location. Right next to a metro station and a short walk from city centre.

Maia was also very kind and helpful to reach there and welcomed me at the door.\n\nElevator was \""a little bit\"" slow but I didn't care since I don't have a rush :)\n\nMaybe, only improvement could be made is inner design of bathroom. Except that, flat is really perfect for one or  two guests."", ""Maia was a fantastic host and we're so glad we chose this apartment.

I will come back for sure when the weather will be warmer! Thank you Maia"", ""I've stayed 6 days in Maia's appartement. It is very cosy and has everything I needed. But most of all Maia is one of the kindest and most considerate hosts I've ever met. So I highly recommend this."", ""Everything was great"", ""The apartment is great! It is located near the centre and you can defenetley see the city by foot. Overall the apartment is quite bit, even though the bathroom amd kitchen are quite small, but that was not a problem for us. Maia was a great host and welcomed us nicely. Would defenetley recommend to anyone!"", ""The studio is well located. The place is really calm and has the essentials. Also Maia is a very good host.

My plane landed quite late in Sofia, yet she didnt had too much problem waiting for my arrival what was really nice."", ""Maia is the best host I met at airBNB. We arrived at 3 a.m..

Really liked the location and all the space. "", ""On the plus side - the place is conveniently located in the very city centre. \nMaia was a lovely and welcoming host, very attentive. \nThe place is true to pictures and description. \n\nA pair of earplugs is worthy having with, one for the elevator noises, second for the central heating in the bedroom that makes funny noises when turned on to the maximum. "", ""I did not get the pleasure of meeting Maia but I did spend the weekend in the apartment and had a great time in Sofia. The apartment is clean and tidy and has everything you need. I would highly recommend staying at Maia's flat if you are visiting Sofia."", ""Maia is super nice and helped us a lot to come around in Sofia. The flat is located in the centre and everything you need is in reach. With regard to previous comments: the elevator is indeed noisy, but it is rarely in use during the night, so it did not bother us. One disadvantage is the bathroom: There is a certain smell coming from the toilet (maybe due to the pipes?). That was the only thing that a little disturbed us. \r\nhowever, rest was fine and I would highly recommend this flat! \r\n\r\nThanks, Maia! :)"", ""Maia was a lovely host and the apartment was central to everything. The only negatives were that the bathroom had a horrible small coming from the toilet - perhaps it was a chemical toilet, the bed was not big enough for two people to sleep in comfortably - it was very squishy, and the bedroom is right next to the building's elevator which is unbearably noisy and woke us up during the night. \n\nIf you are looking for a super cheap and basic place for a couple of days, it would be a good option."", ""Perfect place to stay, it has everything you need, and it's in a good zone.

The Bulgarian-style bathroom was bijou, but my boyfriend (The Functionality King) loved how it all fit together and was super practical. \r\n\r\nThis flat is on a surprisingly quiet street on the edge of a massive park, but it was only 30 seconds walk to shops and an easy 10 minute walk to Vitosha Boulevard. \r\n\r\nFor Sofia activities, we took a really cool Communist historical walking tour- highly recommend it and it was super interesting!

The place is very clean and tidy and the wifi is super fast. \n\nBrilliantly located, the apartment is a few minutes walk to the very heart of the city and even closer to an array of parks and recreation areas; including the national stadium. Navigating public transport is also a breeze from this place. \n\nAfter providing us with fantastic directions before our arrival, Maia waited for us at the tram stop - despite our bus running late. She gave us a good rundown of the city using a really cool map with lots of tips on what to see and where to go.

She had also prepared a small map and she informed me about the Sofia International Film Festival which was taking place during my stay. I stayed in the apartment for 3 weeks and had a great stay. The apartment was also big enough for my family to come and visit for a week during my stay since there is a couch in the living room that you can sleep on. I also liked that the kitchen felt at home with all the things you need to cook, and also tea, coffee, pasta etc. That was great since I had to do quite a bit of cooking during my stay.The location is also great, close to busstop from the airport, close to city centre and close to a great park where I did a lot of walking and jogging.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to others. "", ""We stayed in Maia's place in Sofia for 6 weeks and we loved living there. It's in a fantastic location in the city- bus stop outside the door, tram line and metro are 2minutes walk. The National Stadium is down the street with great gym facilities and fitness classes. Sofia is a food lovers heaven with loads of nice restaurants to choose from, most of which are within walking distance of Maia's apartment. \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is really nice. It's bright, cosy and modern and has everything you could need for a short or long stay. The kitchen has pots, pans, plates, cups, etc- there are two hobs and a microwave/oven for cooking.

Maia was really helpful before we arrived, answering all our questions about living in Sofia.

The location of the apartment is also excellent, the city centre, excellent restaurants, fresh veg and fruit markets are just a few minutes walk away. It is also very close to some nice parks so we could enjoy some nice walks early in the morning. We were there with our 18 months old daughter and the apartment is also in a very safe area.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is also very clean, cosy and well equipped for a short city break as described by her and as can be seen in the pictures. If I would go back to Sofia again, I would definitely rent her apartment again.

I moved out two days earlier, and she agreed to give me a part of my money back, which I highly appreciate.\r\n"", ""Maia was a wonderful host who responded almost immediately the whole time, was punctual once we got there and handled all our requests with consideration and care. Her place was everything it promised, if not even more. Located virtually in ground zero of the Sofia downtown, it has the key places of interest within walking distance and every means of transportation available just around the corner. On the other hand, the apartment overlooks a very dormant backyard ensuring you can enjoy the quiet and sleep in after a busy day exploring Sofia's buzzing life. Clean, minimalistic, and with all utilities functioning properly. Enough storing capacity in the bedroom and ample space in the living room. (Friendly advice: Don't rely on the sofa to serve as a third bed.) Bathroom certainly not suitable for human giants but just right in all other cases. The kitchen corner is a nice touch and although one would most likely never eat in, I imagine preparing a simple meal should not be a problem. There were even typical local spices in jars, as well as honey, tea, coffee and the like. All in all, this is a place for those who want to stay at the heart of the Bulgarian capital while experiencing the simple comfort of a place carrying the character of early 20-th century (?) architecture and living space. I wouldn't think twice before booking Maia's studio next time I'm in Sofia."", ""Maia's apartment is very well located. Walking distance from pretty much any attraction and at a crossroads of buses, tram and subway; you could not ask for a better location.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is very good; good size and it has everything you need. \r\nOnly 2 things to be weary about - while there is no noise from the street at all; the elevator and the fridge do get noisy. Also, the apartment is exactly as in the photos: the washroom is extremely small and there is no actual shower.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this 2 issues; my stay in the apartment was very, very good.

There were other guests too, in the other rooms -the ones were very friendly and we had a nice chat; the others were \""invisible\"", but left traces of dirt, which wasn't good. Anyway.

When we got up in the main hallway, everything was dark except 1 room which had a red light and scary noises coming out from the room. Several cockroaches passed our way, so we just went straight downstairs and left the place. Horrible experience, the closest real thing to Scary Movie.

It is all spotless. One should keep in mind that the district Zone B-5 has its harsh post-socialist vibe - just to be prepared for its unpleasant looks. As far as safety is considered, I did not have any issues even walking home at the night time (plus, for the peace of one's mind there are always cheap taxis available). The building itself is very old and the common facilities are malfunctioning, broken or completely missing. However, it does not reflect Nenko's apartment and the overall atmosphere at all! Bulgaria is slowly but surely getting there...\nNenko is a nice and honest host who walks those extra miles for his guest's convenience. It is very easy to talk to him and find a piece of advice or a compromise (or a story), respectively. He gives one their privacy, but is also reachable, if needed. Nenko's mother was staying with him at the time - very nice and quiet old lady (quite a pity that I cannot speak Bulgarian), one could hardly notice her.\nThe offered breakfast was tasty - again, if one cannot schedule the time or doesn't feel like having breakfast, it is without a problem to decline the offer.\nNenko left after 4 days into my stay and came back a day before my departure - all the details had been arranged on time, I had everything I need at my disposal and Nenko was indeed always available through the chat.\nTo be completely honest, first I was a bit overwhelmed by the district, but it all went away very fast and I ended up having a beautiful stay at Nenko's place (including 2 lovely evenings at the balcony). I can only recommend it!\n\nThank you for everything, Nenko!"", ""All I can say is Perfect! This is my most great experience of being hosted in Airbnb.

The value is good considering the central location of the apartment to attractions in Sofia, the VERY fast WiFi,  responsive host and quiet apartment. The biggest problem for us was that the bathroom floods with water whenever you take a shower. There is no separate shower lip, so when you take a shower the water goes on the bathroom floor to a small drain. This is not practical if you have to take a shower for more than 2-3 minutes. Also, there was visible dog or cat hair on the couch. Overall, if you stay here for a short time then this apartment is perfect, but longer than 3 days then it can get to be frustrating.

It takes only a few minutes (5 at the most) to get to the closest metro station and from there it's only one stop to the central station (Serdika).

There's a small grocery store on the other side of Lavov Most (a Billa) and a larger one (a Lidl) about 10 minutes away near the public fountains.\n\nThe apartment itself is comfortable, spacious, and clean and has a full kitchen (with a washing machine), a comfortable couch and bed, and a nice little bathroom.

Since we had a late flight into Sofia, Iva had confirmed that checking in at 2 am local time would not be an issue. We arrived in front of the apartment at exactly 2 am and tried to the number Iva had given us to collect the keys, as discussed. However, we received no answer through calling, texting, or messaging on the airbnb application. After waiting over an hour in the street and calling over 10 times we had to find alternative accommodation for the night, which was further complicated by the lack of hotel rooms in the area. After checking into a hostel around 4 am we finally received a call from Iva's business partner, apologizing for an emergency which had apparently prevented our hosts from getting into contact with us. Upon realizing that we had been waiting and forced to search a foreign city for accommodation in the middle of the night, Iva's partner did try to rectify the situation by covering the cost of our hostel and picking us up in a cab. The next day Iva offered to remove the cost of the night we missed due to the incident, which was appropriate considering we did not get to check-in on that day.

This Airbnb is actually taken care of by two WONDERFUL hosts-Iva and her friend Kris. When you can't reach one, you usually get the other, for anything you need, within reason. They aren't far from the flat, so timing is not a bad wait either. They are a wonderful resource for local insight as well as good old fashioned Balkan welcoming. We only had a couple hiccups during our stay but they were taken care of and not any faults with the host. The flat was very clean and straightforward with common necessities available.

After spending the day exploring the city, we loved coming back to Maxi's place and putting a record on whilst relaxing in this fantastic apartment.

We had a new one delivered to the apartment before the kids went to sleep our first night in Sofia. We would definitely stay at the apartment again if ever in Sofia again.

Absolutely loved it and recommend it."", ""Sofia is a beautiful city and the AirBnB is in a great location, all the sites are easy to get to by foot. The walking tour that Diliana and Slav provided got us to all of the sights and they were quick in responding to any other questions we had. The apartment was great to relax in and on top of that the weather was lovely. Definitely a great trip!"", ""Really cool looking place with great views of the mountain. Check in was very easy. Beds were great and shower is amazing, but hot can run out so spread out the rota. Lovely touches and 5min walk to metro (serdika)."", ""Slav and Diliana\u2019s flat is very clean and well furnished. It is more beauty than in the photos. It is comfortable and recently renovated. Slav was a great host even though we didn\u2019t meet him in person.

Highly recommended."", ""Diliana and Slav's apartment is exactly as shown. Its a beautiful space.  Diliana and Slav provided very clear check in instructions, and emailed us a couple of times during our trip to make sure we had everything we needed. In fact, Diliana even brought over a missing piece for the espresso machine. We looked forward to the view of Mt. Vitosha every day. Their recommendations for restaurants is spot on- Go to Furna Bakery and Mehana Mamin Kolyo - you won't be disappointed. There is an elevator. It is very small, quite old, but don't be alarmed! The machinery is clearly current and it ran very smoothly. The shower is wet-room style, with a partition separating from the toilet, rather than a completely enclosed shower stall. The water pressure was fantastic and the puddles drain pretty quickly.\n\nThis is a true neighborhood, within a block of the Women's Market, full of locals going about their business. We walked everywhere from their place, but if you like there is a tram across the street, the subway about 8 minutes walk. It took us maybe 30 minutes to walk to Aleksander Nevsky Cathedral. This was my first Airbnb stay and I was not disappointed at all.\nCheers,\nGina and Norah"", ""Lovely modern clean appartment! Perfect location! Close to everything you need! Easy self check in! Definitely recommend! Thank you again!"", ""This flat is amazing! Even better than the pictures! The neighbourhood is really nice and the position is convenient to many places because it is just in the centre of the city. 4 minute walking from the metro and many trams just downstairs. Diana and Slav sent me many suggestions and a wonderful (Hidden by Airbnb) map with all the direction (food and must see places) and two tours of the city. It was very easy communicating with them and they very very fast in replying. The apartment is fully equipped, also the kitchen but probably you'll take the advantage of the restaurants and markets. Having a nap on that hammock is just super relaxing and you can (Email hidden by Airbnb) e to Sofia. You'll be impressed! Can't wait to be back in Sofia and no doubt to stay in this flat."", ""Absolute dream flat! Fully recommend!"", ""The apartment is exactly as advertised - the hosts add a personal touch too which makes your stay really that extra special. Thank you both again - we would definitely stay here again."", ""Do not hesitate to book at Diliana and Slav's place! The apartment is in an excellent location in the heart of the city and the view from the hammock is fantastic. Check-in/out was smooth and hassle-free. The apartment was very comfortable and has everything you need. Diliana and Slav even recommended places to eat which were brilliant. Overall we had an amazing stay in Sofia - many thanks."", ""The apartment is like the pictures, cosy and comfortable. I really recommended. The communication and info from the host was clear and they were very kind, and the sheets and towels were very fresh. Good location. The hammock was the best of the house.

Spacious,clean, central location, close to transport links, bars and restaurants. And of course great hosts! "", ""The apartment itself is stunning - finished to a high standard yet still homely and comfortable. Perfect for a relaxing getaway. It's an ideal location for exploring the city, and you get a good view from the windows too (6th floor). We stayed for two nights. The kitchen has everything you need to self-cater should you wish (we cooked our own dinner and breakfast), and the apartment is spotlessly clean. Diliana and Slav were great at communicating all we needed to know, and we're on hand should we need any help. They also offered great suggestions, suited for our trip (places to eat, how to get around, etc). The enterance to the flat can be a little tricky to find, but if you follow the instructions, you shan't have a problem. You may need a torch as the communal hallway & stairwell (before you get into the flat) doesn't have lights. I would stay there again. Very nice flat, great hosts."", ""The place is very cosy and clean. We especially liked the hammoc and the wall you can write on with chalk  Diliana and Slav were very helpful and caring hosts - they took care so that we have everything we need and even have left us a pack of nice cookies as welcome gift. The neibourghood is interesting and colorful, there's market for fresh products nearby. We could easily walk to all interesting places in the city.

Hij was altijd bereikbaar, beantwoorde al onze vragen snel en vertelde over de highlights van Sofia m.b.v. een kaart. Het appartement is erg knus en bevat alles wat je nodig hebt tijdens een citytrip zoals handdoeken, een fohn, waterkoker, koelkast, etc. De douche kan er gek uit zien, maar hij werkt prima! Ook is er wifi in het appartement. \n\nTips voor een citytrip zijn de free Sofia tour, the new Sofia pub crawl (hidden bar tour) en de balkan food tour."", ""\u8fd9\u4e2a\u623f\u5b50\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684,\u9002\u5408\u65c5\u6e38\u5c45\u4f4f,\u4e00\u5ba4\u4e00\u5385\u4e00\u536b,\u4e0d\u80fd\u505a\u996d,\u5176\u4ed6\u90fd\u5f88\u597d,\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u9ad8!"", ""Un alojamiento muy c\u00e9ntrico y confortable, muy acogedor, el anfitri\u00f3n nos vino a buscar al aeropuerto a las 4 am por 15 euros, lo cual nos vino de lujo.

This place equipped with all staff that you need: pots, cups, glasses, dishes, and of course fridge, toaster, dish washer. What is more, you will find good coffee, tea, and even cookies in this kitchen.\n\nCLEAN. All place smells incredible good, you won't find any dirty places. They provide you with bed linen, towels, extra pillows.\n\nOWNER. Radost and her daughter are extremely welcoming and supported us every time when we needed some help either call the taxi or allow to spend in the place extra hours before leaving.\n\nP.S.

He gave me a tour of the apartment and even helped me find a place to get some food late at night.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant stay and I'll be keen to stay again next time I go to Sofia."", ""A lovely apartment a short walk from Orlov Bridge, just like in the pictures, a well stocked kitchen with a coffee machine, TV with plenty of channels. We had some problems with check in as the directions could have been even clearer as you simply cannot find 'Sofia University' on the metro system map - it is abbreviated as SU St Kliment Orhidski and that is the name of the station that Monica should have given us and not Sofia University. That led to us getting lost and delayed on our arrival. Also, we lost hot water for about 16 hours - granted that was not the fault of the host, but communication was sketchy at best during that period and I wasn't going to stay in the flat when I had no hot water. I had made it explicitly clear to Monica that I was going to go out sightseeing the next day (hot water or not) and she still sent me a message at like 10 am asking me if there was hot water and I was like, I can't tell, I am out on Mt Vitosha now, can you check for me? No reply.  Like seriously, common sense please: who gets an AirBNB apartment and then stays in all day? Otherwise, I understand that Monica & Jordan manage a number of AirBNB apartments/lodgings across Sofia and she must have been too busy to get back to me given that she is working full time too. Shame things went wrong, but I am deducting one star for that - I've had much better experiences. The location wasn't as central as I thought but I could cope - Orlov Bridge and the metro station are a good 10 - 15 mins walk away and that's fine if you're young and happy to walk but for people like my parents, they won't be happy walking that distance. Monica also didn't seem to know the local neighbourhood well as she wasn't able to answer my questions about arrival late at night when I asked her if anything was going to be open - in fact, plenty of things were (Subway, McDonald's Billa Supermarket etc) up till 11 pm and Subway was 24 hours but she could only direct me to a tiny 24 hours alcohol/tobacco shop which didn't really do food. Like I said, lovely apartment but I think they could have improved the communication. It wasn't even a language issue as Monica's English was perfect - it's just being able to see things from the guests' point of view and understanding our needs. "", ""Very nice Apartment in a great area of sofia. The communication was easy and i will defenetly come back. "", ""Verry good place to stay. Friendly and helpfull neighbours, close to the metro, close to stores and quiet neighbourhood. The place itself was verry clean and had good internet connection.

Distance-wise, its pretty walkable, the train station is a 5-10 min walk away, or you can walk to the center in 20 mins or so.

He also showed us a couple of videos he had created using traditional Bulgarian musicians.

Right in the heart of Sofia with lots of shops, restaurants, bars all within walking distance.\n* It's also a good location if you need to visit other places in Sofia as there are two metro stations pretty close by.\n* The room is basic, but absolutely fine and has a nice little seating area, both inside as well as outside on the terrace with an amazing view of Sofia.\n* The bed has a pretty good mattress, so you'll wake up refreshed.\n* The shower is good, warm & strong, though not suitable for long showers as the water doesn't drain quickly enough, so at some point the bathroom will overflow.\n* The wifi worked absolutely fine.\n* The room is equipped with a water cooler/heater, which makes for tastier water than the tap water. So if you have your own water bottle, you won't need to keep buying water, but can just fill it up.\n* Svetoslav and his wife are very friendly and gave some good advise on things to do while I was there.\n\nOn the down side:\n* There were some hick-ups, both when checking-in and checking-out.\n* The toilet in the bathroom is leaky which meant that the bathroom floor was always wet.\n* Also, there is no place or hangers to hang out your clothes, so you'll basically be in suitcase wrinkled clothes for the duration.\n* The room isn't suitable for very tall people as I'd guess that the ceiling is at approx 2 meters. In the same vein, I got the impression that the bed is only 1.90 long."", ""Perfect for couples exploring sofia together. Had a great time, especially enjoyed the sunny rooftop terrace.

The host didn't answer because it was 2 am so we had to go and get a room in a hostel. However he quickly returned the money for that night so this was very professional of him. The other problem is that the bathroom needs to get fixed as soon as posible, you can't take a shower without the floor being flooded with water, we had to use towels to dry it but even then you get wet and it was an inconvenience to the point it made us not want to shower.\nEverything else was fine, I guess we just had bad luck with this trip,  the host was nice and helpful, he did what he could in that situation."", ""Small, cosy but a well maintained apartment.

We arrived at 6:45pm and the security guard had no keys and no knowledge of anyone who should leave keys. We tried calling the numbers left for us by the owners but all phones were off and we let messages as well as texted and sent air b&b messages. We had to leave and find somewhere to sit until we finally heard back about an hour later. We were again advised that the keys were at security. \n\nWe went back and the keys were indeed there. No one greeted us or gave any brochure or information on the apartment. We had to wait until the next day until we were contacted after leaving messages to get the wifi information. \n\nThe apartment itself is quite cute and bed is comfortable, however there were still food and beverage items leftover from the previous renters in the mini fridge and the sheets smelled if dust. We stayed 7 days and the biggest issue with the apartment itself is the way the shower is setup so you always get water all over the floor no matter what you do. We went through all the floor towels and were not contacted about any extra amenities over the next 7 days. \n\nThe biggest problem of all was the second last day when at noon there was a knock at the door and 4 men decided there was an issue with the wifi and they needed to set up something new due to a conflict with the apartment owners in the bottom of the building (original owners of wifi).\n\nWe had just finished a nap, so I had to lock myself in the bathroom sans pants as there was no time to even change. There was no phone call or attempt to contact us at all. This was very upsetting as we should have had complete privacy when renting an entire apartment for 7 days unless contacted first. We mentioned this and got excuses and a half hearted apology.\n\nAll in all, it's a cozy little place, but due to our bad experiences with the communication, lack of privacy, etc. We would definitely not stay here again."", ""We were made very welcome although we arrived early but we're able to leave bags whilst the flat was being cleaned   Very central location but quiet and peaceful.

No matter if you prefer to prepare you food in the kitchen ( you won't miss anything if you are in the mood to spend some time next to the oven ) or just to try some Bulgarian or international cuisine - Greek, Turkish and Japaneses restaurants are very near. \nThe apartment itself is perfect for one-two persons. The location although  central is very quite so you won't miss any sleep after long day of walking (the great mattress also  helps here :) ), plus the windows and the terrace are facing the inner yard so you can leave them open in the night without warring from the noise on the street. The interior was very modern and  in top condition. The shower and sink in the bathroom perfectly matched the design so you have one very spaces bathroom without any compromises in the amenities. The dishwasher and the oven programming (didn't used the last still noticed it) would be a great help to save time  if you are into preparing your own food, and the frig is with all the space one would need.    \n\nThose are my reasons to recommend this place for anyone looking where to stay in Sofia."", ""Great hosts, perfect location, highly recommended."", ""Great location and very cozy place "", ""The apartament is very modern, stylish and clean! Fully equiped with all amentities you need. The thing that we appreciated the most was the top location. It is located on a quiet street at the heart of the city, 2 minutes walk to the famous commercial street Graf Ignatiev and the street with the best bars and cafes I. Shishman. Also it is in walkable distance to all landmarks and big parks in the town. The check-in is flexible and the host is very kind and approachable. Highly recommend it!"", ""I am from Sofia, born & raised. I stayed in Nadia & Boris' place for a week to accommodate a friend visiting. Here are my top 4 reasons why next time when I need a place in Sofia I will book this place again:\n\n1. This place is located perfectly. It cannot be located better, srsly. On one of the more quiet, greenest streets in the very center of Sofia - so good that the UK embassy and several others chose it for their location. \n2. Incredibly clean, everything is brand new, everything works. High-grade mattress, kitchenware, bath, etc. Much thought put into the design of the studio, feels incredibly cozy. \n3. Has everything you need: coffee machine (and coffee!), iron, ironing board, extra pillows, extra towels, literally anything I could think of - it was there. Even a pencil, once I needed to write something down :) \n4. The hosts were incredibly fast, punctual, warm, friendly, helpful, flexible, and... intelligent (which frankly helps in communication a lot). There is literally nothing I could think of that could be better/more to ask for."", ""We had a great time at Nadia and Boris\u2019 apartment! We stayed together with husband for a week. We found apartment stylish and fully equipped. Everything we need was available. Thanks to large windows it was bright and homy. The check-in and check-out were easy and flexible. The location of apartment was perfect, within walking distance to most important sight of Sofia. We had unforgettable vocation!) For sure we would stay here again when visiting Sofia."", ""It is a beautiful flat, very well-located, stylish and elegant. I really enjoyed it! The check-in and check-out were easy and seamless. I certainly 100% recommend this place!"", ""The house of Nadia and Boris is exactly like in the picture! Every detail is in the right place! The apartment is small but functional, very bright thanks to the large windows (with curtains), the bed is very comfortable and the bathroom has a really spacious shower. It's closer to the stadium than it appears on the map and the location is strategic to reach the main points of the city.

We really enjoyed our stay!"", ""Boris and Nadia\u2019s place was perfect for my 4 day stay in Sofia. Hosts checked me in and gave me local tips! Super nice couple! Communication was timely and excellent. Good location and within walking distance to most important sights in Sofia, shops and restaurants. The place was perfect, spacious, clean and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. I would stay here again. \nOnly minor thing was wifi can be super slow especially at night but not a big deal as I had a local SIM. \n\nAnd this is something that the hosts have no control over but to those who are travelling with a vehicle. Parking can be very challenging! It\u2019s only street parking that you have to pay for (cheap) if you can find a spot (very challenging). Nadia was super kind to show me the closest private parking about 150 meters away from the house, however, it\u2019s very expensive and the guy don\u2019t speak a lick of english which was just as frustrating. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s not the hosts fault. It\u2019s just something to keep in mind for travellers with vehicles.  \n\nThanks Nadia and Boris!"", ""We had a great stay. Very stylish and clean.

We loved the small touches that made us feel at home. The hosts had even left an umbrella for us to use on a rainy day in Sofia! :) \nAll of the main attractions are within a \nwalking distance. The studio is situated in the heart of Sofia with plenty of trendy cafes and restaurants nearby. The metro station is approx 5 mins away.\nThe hosts were kind and incredibly helpful and accommodating. Definitely recommend!"", ""I had a great time at Nadia and Boris' place in Sofia! I stayed with my girlfriend in this very nice apartment within 10-15 mins walk to the centre. There are also lots of nice bars and taverns in this area too, and the University is only 10 mins walk away. It was especially nice being right next to the big park so I could go running every day.\n\nThe apartment was perfect, clean and Nadia and Boris were very responsive and quick. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sofia."", ""Nice place in the center of Sofia! "", ""Very clean and comfy apartment very close to the city center. The apartment has a high-quality equipment.

Great location, walking distance from restaurants and shops. Host was very easy and quick to communicate with. Loved our stay here ! "", ""The location range in the listing may be misleading. The apartment is actually closer to Vasil Levski Stadium. Nadia and Boris sent detailed transportation options prior to my stay. My flight was delayed. Peter kindly checked me in around 11:30PM and helped me with my luggage (the apartment is on the 5th floor). Although the interior is very trendy, I was surprised to find food crumbs on the couch, couch pillow, and by the kitchen sink. I wasn't sure whether the cleaning person overlooked it or Peter had some late night snack while waiting for me (he had a beer in his hand when I arrived). I also saw more bugs than most accommodations I've stayed. Friendly hosts but diligent maintenance is needed to keep this new apartment long lasting."", ""We stayed for 4 nights in this stylish and comfortable Airbnb. Located near the stadium - its easy to direct taxi drivers how to get home (and so cheap as it's so Central!). You are so close to the main area of the city and it's a lovely walk. Also very clean!

Nadia&Boris respond very fast for helpful tips!"", ""The place is just as it looks like in the photos. It's clean, bright, newly renovated, and has everything you need. The location is perfect, just a short walk to all the hipster shops, restaurants and bars, and at the same time very residential and quiet."", ""Nadia and Boris are great, reliable and nice hosts. The location of the studio is amazing both from the airport and to the city. Basically you can reach the city center on foot in 15-20 minutes. The studio is very clean, stylish and new. Highly recommended for everyone. Well equipped, quiet and bright. Kitchen is perfect, lot of spaces. The bed was very comfortable. In one word: go for it! \nWe also enjoyed Sofia, great city, lot of huge spaces and parks, public transport is excellent. People are very nice and hospital. Worth to see at least once in a lifetime. \nThank you for the memories and the perfect service for Nadia and Boris!"", ""One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed in. Super stylish. Excellent location 7 mins walk from hip bars/restaurants. Max 20 mins walk to free tours meeting points. Rapid WiFi. \n\nNadia's brother was waiting for me at the apartment. Ask for the buzzer number - my phone didn't work initially so couldn't call to say I was downstairs. Luckily taxi driver was kind and helped me out. \n\nSofia is an amazing city and this apartment is awesome."", ""Nadia's and Boris's apartment is a great base for exploring Sofia. It is centrally located and within walking distance to (e.g.) ul. Tsar Shishman where you can find excellent restaurants and nice boutiques.

We would certainly do so ourselves."", ""The apartment was amazing. A lot of attention was paid to little details, it is very bright and furnished with brand new and modern looking furniture.

We felt at home and we highly recommended the place!"", ""The two of us stayed at Nadia & Boris' place for a long weekend and everything was perfect. Check-in and check-out were super flexible, the reply time was extremely short, the location is perfect - walking distance to almost everywhere in the centre and just around the corner from a metro station. The apartment itself outclassed our expectations: Everything was brandnew (even windows and doors), the kitchen is incredibly well-equipped, the bathroom was super clean and beautiful and all in all, it is so tastefully furnished that we had no choice but to fall in love with it.

Victor not only stayed awake but was also really easy to contact and even met us off the taxi. The area is really residential and chilled.

He waited for me to arrive at the street corner with a great smile.\n\nI was his first AirBnB guest. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures, but the pictures don't show how well the place is equipped. Everything u need in a kitchen, cooking, cleaning, washing, drying, ironing, and Victor left me plenty of amenities,  including great coffee. Great warm water from a heater probably 50 litres big, air condition and a heater, which i never used. The apartment is very stylish, and looks and feels brand new. The bed easily fits a couple, but there are also two sofabeds in the living room. The place is spacious for a couple. The living room has lovely pictures by Victor's talented brother and a beautiful painting by a very talented mother. One of the best features in the apartment is the small balcony in the livingroom\n\nThe place is on the fourth floor, wide easy stairs. A safe quiet great neighborhood, shops and a bar around the corner. The tram that takes you to city center is a one minute walk, also 3 bus stops just as close. I walked from the place to the university metro station that brings you from the airport in 12 minutes. I walked to town everyday in 20 min. The farthest corner of Sofia is 40 minutes away with plenty to see.\n\nP.S. the public transport of Sofia is NOT on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, BUT there is an app called easy way public transport\"" will help greatly.\n\nI recommend Victor and his place a hundred times in writing.\n."", ""Het appartement is net zoals op de foto's, modern en ruim!

If the apartment key gets stuck, pull the door toward you and then turn the key. Such a great stay, the apt is lovely and Zdravka is like the grandmother you wish you had. Her English is good, and her German is amazing. She's the greatest! Bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise, as sometimes the floor squeaks (understandably, though, considering that the building is SUPER old - but just as beautiful!

The appartement is located beautifully in the very center of the city, and we could reach all important spots in a few walking minutes. Anyways, the area is quite and safe. The apartement is very cosy and had everything we needed. Kitchen and bathroom are shared with Zdravka. Since Zdravka speaks german, we got along easily and she helped us with city maps, tram tickets and gave a lot of recommendations. But the best thing was an invitation to take part in a Bulgarian Christmas-/ New Years-Tradition together with Zdravka and her grandson, which was a unique experience and great pleasure!

Loved It!!!"", ""The apartment is very conveniently located in the heart of Sofia, close to public transport, shops, bars etc. The room itself was quite nice and Zdravka was a very helpful host, giving us lots of information for our stay and answering all of our questions. She also booked a taxi for us to travel to Boyana in the outskirts of Sofia. There are just two things I would add. The first is that the entrances of the apartment are only semi-independent (not entirely independent). The second is that the apartment is not very sound-proof (as most apartments from that era). That's not a big problem, but just so that you are aware and know what to expect in terms of privacy.

Check-in was really rushed like he needed to be somewhere else and even when we saw him later, he seemed disinterested in even saying hello.  Part of the issue with our stay here is that everything in this area is central so heating and hot water is for the whole building.  As a result we had no hot water for several days and the central heat (which was not great anyway) only came on in the last week or so of our stay.  Also, since the apartment is on the 2nd floor over the entry of the building, at night the apartment got smoky from cigarettes.  Although in the pictures the furniture looks nice, you could not even open the dresser drawers.  On the plus side, the wifi was great and the bed was nice.

Would definitely recommend"", ""amazing place"", ""Great place, great stay. I really enjoyed being so central, yet in a quiet neighbourhood, and of course the apartment is fully equipped and well furnished."", ""I had the pleasure of living in Nona's apartment for 5 months. It really is a spectacular place to call home. The built-in coffee makers is fantastic! The apartment really has EVERYTHING you need, and because it is a real home, it has lots of things you don't know you need until you need it - things like scissors, needle and thread, glue, and so on. Nona's mom makes sure everything essential is stocked up, so really all you have to buy is food! If you are staying long-term, this makes the apartment a great value. It is quiet, safe, and the building is modern and clean. I loved living in Nona's apartment!"", ""Excellent place, friendly people, would use it again!  "", ""We can't say enough good things about this apartment and the hosts. The location is superb, the apartment is really nicely decorated and incredibly well maintained - everything works. This is rarely the case on airbnb where apartments look much better on the pictures and are often falling apart. It is the best equipped apartment I have stayed in - you have everything you need to feel at home, to cook and to live there long term. The needs of the guests are taken into account in every detail. There is even a scale :) \n\nAnd yet the best part about it are the hosts - Nina is supremely quick in her communication and her mom Maria who took care of us during our two month stay is incredibly kind, thoughtful, and funny. We really had a joyful time getting to know her as she is an exceptional woman. We are very grateful to her for looking after us. It is also the cleanest place we have ever stayed in and she truly impressed us with the quality of everything she did - from fixing the building's door when the handle broke to always providing fresh, ironed towels for us. Thank you both for making these two months a home away from home for us and for all the fond memories we created there! :)"", ""Lovely apartment don't worry about it it's the best location and the jacuzzi gonna make u crazy!"", ""A great place to stay.

Highly recommended."", ""We had a great three weeks in beautiful  Sofia and our apartment was great!  The kitchen was well equipped and the living space very comfortable. \n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t an issue for us as the weather was cool, guests should be advised that the only air conditioning unit is in the living/dining/kitchen space so I would be worried that it might be warm in the bedrooms during a hot spell. \n\nI especially enjoyed the builtin Siemens automatic coffee machine-fresh ground coffee every morning at the push can\u2019t be beat and we are spoiled for the future!"", ""The flat was absolutely great!

Nina was very helpful and quick to respond to questions / phone calls. \n\nWe absolutely loved having the balcony which has a lovely view of the mountain, and he jacuzzi bath was a fun addition too! :)\n\nOutside the apartment was a small cafe where we sat outside to have a beer, and there was also a well stocked supermarket and fruit & veg shop around the corner. Taxis into the centre were very cheap (the app TaxiMe is very handy) and were about 3-4 lev (\u00a31-2). 5 mins walk from the apartment is a great restaurant called Chevermeto and further up from there is Switch bar which has great vibes. If you do one thing whilst you visit it should be the Sofia Pub Crawl tour, it was 20 lev and an amazing night out visiting different bars and meeting new people. \n\nAll in all an amazing weekend away, I would definitely prefer to stay in this apartment rather than closer to the centre as it\u2019s quieter :)"", ""In this flat you fell it's your own house.

The apartment is great for up to five people, very new furniture, great location and it has all amenities that you need."", ""Nina made the whole trip and stay a sheer delight. This was my first experience with Airbnb and I have to say both the host and the apartment made me feel very spoiled. Nina was the first to answer any questions I had by (Hidden by Airbnb) or email and the communication was 1st class.  The apartment was clean, tidy and centrally located ( 15 min walk to city center). The apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood and has a great coffee machine and whirlpool jacuzzi on one of the bathrooms. if you have time to watch TV there are over 150 channels!

It is spacious and definitely equipped with everything you may need. Two bathrooms, with hydromassage shower/bath, two sleeping rooms (silent during the night and well warmed), a great living room with LED tv with satellite and wifi. \nIf you think to stay in Sofia for a long time this could really be a place you may consider your home, because you will feel cuddled, every minute.\nNina was kind and available to help me to find places in the city where to find what I needed."", ""\u201cGreat place!

Highly recommended and Nona is great at responding to any concerns or questions. Thanks Nona."", ""So my friend and I stayed at Nona's beautiful apartment in the middle of July. At the very beginning we treated like family. The apartment was so clean that it looked brand new! The pictures didn't do the apartment justice, which is hard to do since Nona took phenomenal pictures. The bedrooms were spacious, the bathrooms were super clean, and the living room/kitchen had more than enough space. The location was perfect, in a nice quiet area but within easy walking distance to everything! Definitely would stay there again in a heart beat!"", ""I have stayed at this apartment 3 times now, so needless to say I like it very much. This time I had another great experience.

A great location close the centre but still far enough away to be nice and quite. \r\n\r\nThe unit itself had the best of everything which made a longer stay very comfortable. Great beds, kitchen equipment, and  a soaker tub. If it was available we would have extended. Book while you can!

The neighborhood is quiet."", ""The flat was clean, well proportioned and within easy walking distance of the city centre.\nThe bed mattress is a little on the hard side and the large frame that extends around it may cost you a few cuts and bruises if you wake up in the middle of the night.\nThe jacuzzi bath overflows on to the bathroom floor when water goes down the overflow pipe and at night between midnight and 4 am the jacuzzi bath switches itself on automatically (for what and why; no one knows) and cannot be switched off manually during this process. The sound prevents anyone from sleeping or wakes you up.\nApart from these small things we had a pleasant stay.\nPS: the tv on the fridge is too small to be viewed from the sitting room."", ""We stayed in this apartment twice, in October 2014 and in January 2015. We liked it so much the first time that didn't even look for another one when we had to return to Sofia in January. Nona was very helpful and accommodating. We were met by her mother who welcomed us and made sure we knew where everything was in the apartment. The neighborhood is about 20 minutes' walk from the centre and it's very pleasant as you walk on the main central street Vitosha. One thing we really liked is the proximity of the traditional Bulgarian restaurant Chevermeto where you can see a program with Bulgarian folk dances - I highly recommend going there. If you are going in winter, you'll be happy to know that there is central heating and the apartment is very warm. "", ""Our second time there... and still as satisfying as the first visit.

He seemed to be pretty massive and some of the people got scared. Of course we didn`t open, as we don`t know the language and he didn`t seem to have be very friendly at all, but that made the stay there a bit uncomfortable. \nI know is not Radoslav`s fault, but you should keep that in mind in case you`re planning to do any kind of socializing with your friends there that don`t involve whispering."", ""Super nice place, close to center and metro and bus stops if you don't like to walk.

Thank you so much again."", ""This comfortable, modern and tidy apartment in the immediate center of Sofia, gave us the opportunity to spend our time there with maximum pleasure. The apartment is equipped with everything a person might need to feel like at home. It is obvious that the host is thinking about the needs, pleasure and comfort of his guests. Martin was hospitable and ready to help and advice. When comming by car, be aware that the location in the center does not offer a lot of parking opportunities, and organize your stay accordingly (there are several private parking areas in the same street). What I can say for sure is that when visiting Sofia again, this is our place of choice."", ""Out experience was great! The location was exactly what we expected. It was in a great location and easy to get to everything. Martin went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We really enjoyed our stay."", ""The apartment is stunning. It is completely new and I must say that I appreciated very much the way it has been decorated. It felt like everything has been carefully choosen. It is also very central.

They have been very very helpful, very welcoming and I guess one of the nicest memories from Sofia will be the long and deep conversation we had."", ""I have spent 4 nights in this apartment, and it is nothing else but amazing: very clean, quiet, spacious and stylish with extremely light atmosphere. \r\nEverything you might need is just around the corner, and you can feel the spirit of old Sofia combined with the modern environment every detail of which was made with love and care. \r\nMartin is very kind host, ready to help and making sure you have no difficulties.  \r\nThank you so much once again.  If I have a chance to visit Sofia again, I would never choose to stay at any other place. \r\n"", ""We rented the flat for 3 nights and it was perfect. The apartment is very well situated in the very center of Sofia (just next to the Vitosha Boulevard). It is very clean, and has everything needed for a short or long stay. \r\n\r\nMartin is a very nice and kind host, who even offered to give us a lift from the airport considering the hour of our arrival and our little knowledge of the town. He was OK for a late check-in and an early check-out. He made sure everything was fine for our stay.

Wij hebben niks gekookt, ik ben per slot van rekening op vakantie, maar de mogelijkheid was er en dat is prettig. De airco was echt een dikke plus voor de zonnige week die we hadden. De locatie is ook nog eens perfect. De straat van het appartement zelf is lekker rustig, maar paralel eraan liep de vitosha boulevard waar veel leuke caf\u00e9s, restaurants en winkels zitten. Op nog geen 10 minuten ben je bij alle hotspots. Het grootste pluspunt echter aan het appartement is de host. Martin is echt een super lieve host en je kan je geen betere bedenken. Wij zijn door hem opgehaald van het vliegveld, uiteraard wel tegen een kleine vergoeding, hij liet ons tijdig weten wanneer het water zou worden afgesloten vanwege renovaties aan een straat verderop en we mochten onze spullen zelfs nog tot 's avonds laat in het appartement van zijn zus stallen totdat we naar het vliegveld moesten. Als ik dan perse een minpunt moet noemen zijn dat de bedden, omdat het twee enkele bedden zijn. Als je als stel komt, moet je er wel op instellen dat je niet tegen elkaar aan kan kruipen.

You can walk to all of the main attractions easily, and there are restaurants, bars, shops, parks and cafes nearby.  \n\nParking was a little bit of an issue - we had to go outside of the more central bit to park in the 'green zone' which is free most (but not ALL!) Saturdays.  Nadia's place is in the 'blue zone' which is not free.  The green zone also costs on Monday - Friday but we were just lucky to be there on Friday night - Saturday.  Parking is definitely a bit of an issue in Sofia so I would think twice before hiring a car - if you're travelling around Bulgaria best to pick up the car upon leaving Sofia, I think. \n\nThat being said, the walk back to Nadia's house from the green zone was only approx ten minutes so nothing to really complain about!\n\nOverall, a great base for Sofia.\n"", ""Lovely, spacious apartment.

We would have no hesitation in recommending this apartment.  \nPapa Joe's restaurant just up the road is particularly recommended -cheap and has English version of the menu and friendly helpful owner and staff. \nWould highly recommend a train trip into the Balkans from the Central Railway Station.  Stopped off in Mezdra before returning.  Nothing much there but there is a cheap local restaurant.  Pot luck with the menu as not in English but you can manage if not picky about what you eat!!!"", ""Nevena contributed to us having an amazing time in Sofia, she was helpful and went a long way to accommodate for our timetable and even let us check out late.

The apartment itself is comfortable and clean, in a good location. \r\n\r\nOne thing I don't like about this building (and lots of other Bulgarian buildings) is that the front door is locked even from the inside, so it is impossible to even exit the building without the key, which, in addition to being a safety issue, can be very restricting to a party of more than one person. For our first day we only had one set of keys, which was quite tricky for our party of 4, as we weren't always moving around together. On the second day we asked for another set of keys, and Nevena's husband brought them over just a few hours later. So, here's a tip: if you are a party of more than one, you'll want to ask ahead for a second set of keys for more flexibility and safety. \r\n\r\nOther than that one issue, our stay at this lovely apartment was wonderful, and we recommend it to prospective guests.

The location is wonderful. We would happily stay at this home again."", ""We spent 5 nights in Nevenas beautiful apartment and are happy we chose it.  The 2 bedrooms are very spacious and the beds comfortable. Everything that you will need is in the apartment.   Given that the apartment is located in the city centre,  we were surprised how delightfully  quiet the street was.   You can walk to all the attractions.  We did take a taxi home one evening, price is no more than a couple of euro.  Small supermarket nearby and also a 24 hour petrol station,  which had limited groceries.

Sofia is awesome and this appartment made our stay even better. Nevena is a really kind and nice housekeeper.

One thing for potential renters: note that the second bedroom (shown in photos) is only unlocked if you are 4 or more people- I'm not sure that the apartment description indicates that.

Communication was excellent and her appartment is an Oasis amidst a more traditional and less swanky appartment block/area but with such lovely people around.  After a long race the stairs seemed a bit of a challenge but other wise what a lovely stay we had.

La posizione \u00e8, come gi\u00e0 accennato, in una zona molto tranquilla e soprattutto a pochissimi passi dal centro della citt\u00e0 (circa 10 minuti a piedi) , dove in effetti sono racchiusi un po tutti i posti da visitare; noi, fatta eccezione per la chiesa di Boyana (a circa 8km dal centro) abbiamo girato Sofia praticamente a piedi.

They was friendly and helpful to suggest us places to visit, local, restaurant ecc...\nThey greeted us with three welcome gifts, two local beers, typical Bulgarian caramels, and a detailed map of all the tourist and culinary attractions in the area. The house is \""no shoes inside\"" so you have to walk in crocs or slippers. The location is situated, as mentioned above, in a very quiet area and especially just a few steps from the city center (about 10 minutes walk), where in fact are enclosed a bit all the places to visit; we, except for the Boyana's Church (about 8km from the center) visited Sofia practically on foot. Besides, at 100 meters from the house, there is a LIDL (supermarket) where you can buy anything you need.

The water from the sink of kitchen leaks so it might bother when sleeping, also the water in the bathroom leaks so you have to careful because it gets slippery. The shower is ok, hot water runs out quiet fast so if two people want a shower one should wait for it.\nOh, the breakfast is included but you get it once on the first day during your stay, not everyday. The yogurt he got for us was really good. \n\nThe host is friendly, and he always responds so it was very helpful. "", ""Ilian's apartment was really a great place to stay.

There is a kettle and an Italian coffee maker. The bedroom has a very comfy sofa to sit and the bed is a queen size bed fairly comfortable. The bathroom is right outside the studio and we were fine with it. I think you will be usually sharing it with another person who stays next door but he was not there during our stay. There were little things to be fixed here and there because the apartment is a little old but Ilian was always available to help. You just have to be ok with unexpected issues.

The bed was comfy and I apprecied the black curtains that made it possible to have a complete darkness for good sleep.\n\nValentin is easy deal with, and he made it a breeze to check in and out.

Perfect, thank you."", ""The amenities: Valentin\u2019s apartment is a gem! This is probably one of the best decorated places I stayed at in over 17 years of traveling. The apartment is clean, well equipped and shows pride in ownership. I was surprised to find an AC unit in every room - that\u2019s something not many Bulgarian homes have (usually one unit per appartment). Valentine was not cheap in his choice of quality. All furniture and decorations are top notch. The mattresses were very comfortable, I believe memory foam. Pillows and sheets felt soft and comfy. Hair dryer, iron, soap, shampoo and conditioner were provided and the towels  smelled fresh and clean. \nLocation: only a few min walk from Main Street with shopping, restaurants, and night life. All main tourist attractions downtown  are within 15-30 min walk from his place. We suggest you take the \u201cSofia free tour\u201d which will give you a 2 hr walk around those attractions. \nThe host: Valentine made the check in instructions very easy to follow with step by step explanation and pictures. He messaged us quickly answering questions and provided alternative ways to reach him in case of an emergency. He was available to answer questions, help us find the place (I\u2019m directionally challenged with a GPS in my hand), provided us with links for restaurants and night life. \nMy only regret was that we didn\u2019t stay longer. We will definitely return to his apartment next time we visit family in Bulgaria and plan to extend our stay at Valentine\u2019s apartment. "", ""This is an absolutely fantastic apartment and is excellent value. The inside is extremely stylish and spacious and the air conditioning was a life saver on the hot days!! The beds were comfortable and kitchen came with a coffee machine and coffee!\n\nThe apartment is on a quiet residential street 5/10 minutes walk from all of the main attractions in Sofia. It is on the 4th floor with no lifts - good exercise for burning off the great food!\n\nValentin was an excellent host. He was extremely responsive and helped suggest places for a celebratory lunch and was happy for us to check in at 4am following a late flight. He also gave other tips in the area that we followed and were amazing such as the free sofia walking tour, and dinner at Raketa Rakia bar with drinks at Sputnik that I would highly recommend. \n\nOverall we had a great time and I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Sofia. "", ""Great location and easily walkable to great landmarks, restaurants/cafes, and nightlife.  "", ""Valentin's place was the most stylish airbnb we have used - it looks exactly like the photos. It was centrally located - within walking distance of the city centre and the central bus / train stations. The bed is big and comfortable and the shower was amazing (although there is no shower curtain so the whole bathroom gets pretty wet, but we didn't mind). We absolutely loved the apartment and really enjoyed our stay there. Would love to come back and would definitely recommend it to anyone! "", ""Thanks Valentin, we had a lovely stay at your beautiful, creative place"", ""Awesome place, Great price. I think Valentin works hard to make your stay a good one. He was very polite and if you had any questions he could answer them timely. I would recommend his place if you are interested in staying in a quiet area with less traffic than the main areas of Sofia. Also, make sure if you rent a car there, Freshen up on Sofia parking laws... they\u2018re a real treat :)"", ""My 2nd time here. Will keep using it"", ""Our group of 4 loved staying in Valentin's home in Sofia!  Valentin is an amazing host, one of the best I have had experience with!  He was proactive in reaching out to us prior to check-in and provided detailed instructions for self-check-in making it a breeze.  He also gave us great local suggestions for how to spend our time in the city.  Valentin was quick to respond to any inquiries and was very flexible with check-out, allowing us to store our luggage until our late night flight.  \nThe home itself is beautiful and stylishly designed with modern touches.  It could comfortably sleep 6 people as the common space has a separate door that could be closed off for those on the sofa bed.  The air-conditioning in each room is a great perk in the hot Sofia summers.  Note that it is a 4th-floor walk-up so this would be the only drawback if you have mobility issues.  The home is so comfortable that I would happily book here for an extended stay as well.   Highly recommended!"", ""Nice place in a central location.

You'd never know from the street how amazing it is! The apartment was spotless and check-in procedures were straightforward; it was so nice to be able to come and go on our own time. This didn't bother us at all, but be aware that a neighbor practices piano each day at 9:30 am sharp, so if you're both a light and a late sleeper, it might be something to keep in mind.

I've never been in such a place for this value of money!

But seriously, get off at Serdika: the area is much more pleasant. Keep in mind that the trip from/to the airport could take longer than expected; it was 1.5-2 hours each way for me. Groceries and a mall are walking distance away. The studio doesn't have a stovetop (only a microwave) but is well equipped otherwise. The kitchen is separated from the bedroom by a plaster wall. There's indeed no separate shower cabin, but there are a showerhead and a sinkhole in the floor, so you just take a shower in the lavatory itself \u2015 no problems.

It feels unsafe in the beginning, however it is not. \n2)The shower space is small,so be mindful to remove the toilet roll before the shower or it gets soiled.\n3)Lastly, the drying space for clothes. you can either dry is outside towards the car park, which is also the entrance for others in the building, thus not convenient for anyone or inside the house, resulting in your clothes smelling damp.\n4) There is no gas or cooking equipment( it was clearly mentioned to me before I booked the apartment) but has a microwave.\n\nTo sum it up, I had an excellent stay in this apartment and I had started feeling like home.

It is located on a walking distance to the city center,  and you can find everything you need in the area. The flat is very bright when there is sun outside. And if you are lucky and the weather is nice, you can watch the moon and the stars from the ceiling windows while you are in the bed.\n \nIn addition Liliya and Dimitar were extremely amiable, considerate and easy-going hosts. I didn't have the chance to meet personally with Liliya, but she gaved me valuable suggestions about the area and was always available when I had questions or challenges.  \nHighly recommended!"", ""Thanks to Liliya's apartment my girlfriend and I spent great time at Sofia. Apartment was clean and very romantic. We didn't meet Liliya but she arranged keys and everything perfectly. Everything was smooth and nice. Liliya's place will be my first choice for next visit of Sofia."", ""Great place, great location, great hospitality and receptiveness to additional request, stylish interior design of this maisonette, and great location. Totally worth it and comes highly recommended from my stay here in Sofia for 40 days."", ""Description and pictures exactly as it is in real life. Liliya was very helpful and greeted us, was very quick to respond. The house is lovely in general with a very good location. Would stay again :)"", ""Liliya was a kind and thoughtful host,  very attentive and helpful with any questions I had. The place itself is beautiful, with a balcony and view of the mountain and all the necessary appliances to make the most of a stay here. Brilliant location, comfortable bed- couldn\u2019t have asked for better. I stayed here for six weeks and would recommend to anyone visiting Sofia whatever the length of their stay. I hope to be back!"", ""We enjoyed our stay in Liliyas apartment very much. We would and will highly recommend the apartment to people who also plan a trip to Sofia.

I had a family emergency at the end (grandma in the hospital) so left Sofia very quickly to see her before she passed, and my friend continued staying at the Air B&B. I messaged Liliya about this the next morning, and she didn't seem happy about it but also didn't want to move forward in a different way, when I offered for my friend to leave immediately. I understand where she's coming from, as it's her apartment, and I feel bad about the circumstance.\n\nOther than that, which is my fault, everything went smoothly. I love this neighborhood a lot... It's a safe part of Sofia and there are two big grocery stores near by and a fantastic outdoor market nearby as well. Also a very inexpensive vegan restaurant, Kring, just around the corner. \n\nA couple slight things to note... The shower will stay warm for about ten minutes. And the bed is very, very firm... Which could be fine if you like a firm bed. Check in went well for me, but I could imagine it being tricky if you don't have phone service, so perhaps ask for the wifi-code beforehand... I believe it reaches outside the building."", ""I highly recommend this apartment. Great location, well appointed and excellent value. Liliya is a great host; friendly, prompt with replies, and gave us some great local tips."", ""We stayed for 1 month - the house is incredible, beautiful, and really well located!

I was quite sad in the taxi on my way to the airport ... !!! ...\n \n \n\n"", ""This is a great little place -- cool layout, so much great light, really well-stocked, and a great location (away from the hustle and bustle, but still close enough to everything).  Liliya and her brother were excellent hosts, the wifi was great, I found some great cafes in the neighborhood, and overall I really enjoyed the apartment. I had a really nice, three week stay in Sofia, and it was always a pleasure to start my days in this space, and to come home to it after my adventures in the city :)"", ""I just spent one the happiest months of my life living in Liliya's charming and comfortable home. She welcomed me personally, and on the day I left, her husband arrived promptly to assist with check-out. I had everything I needed to truly feel at home while working remotely. The view of Mt Vitosha and the quietness evoked the countryside, yet I was a mere stroll from the city center. The neighborhood is safe, close to caf\u00e9s, grocery stores, a very cool co-working space, public transportation, & more.

Definitely a great place to discover Sofia !"", ""At the time of making the initial arrangements, everything was great. Liliya was quick to respond and everything was completely clear.  I was really looking forward to being in Liliya''s place, and had heard from people in Sofia what a great area the apartment is in.

The apartment is about 25 min walk from the center of town, which was great exercise each day we went out.   We also checked out some really nice and quaint restaurants and coffee shops nearby (on the other side of the park) .\n\nKitchen amenities and condiments were nice and appreciated (olive oil, cooking oils and some dressing, as well as salt and pepper).  As well as soaps, shampoos raincoats, umbrellas, an outlet converter, books and recipes on Bulgarian culture and cuisine.\n\nIvailo was a great host and answered all our questions promptly.

The building and the apartment are a bit old and quirky (for instance getting up to the 6th floor on one of the oldest elevators I've ever ridden in and the existence of 3 separate rooms housing 2 toilets and the shower space) but in this quirkiness is tremendous charm.

Dimitar and Peter are amazing people, they treated me like they knew me before, I felt I was with friends from the past, I felt at home; we enjoyed some bottles of wine together and had a great talk. Dimitar cooks incredible good, he cooks for his friends, so I was lucky to be able to try his delicious and tasty inventions ;)   I recommend 100% staying at Dimitra's place."", ""This is almost not useful to future airbnb\u2019ers because I just fell so immediately in friend-love with both Dimitar and his flatmate Peter that I can\u2019t even write a good critical review... So first of all, GREAT PEOPLE. But as far as the guest experience goes, also great. They were super-responsive, committed to making sure I had all the info I needed for an optimal Sofia experience, ready to leave me alone and to welcome me into their existing life, as I liked. The bedroom is huge and peaceful, minimalist without seeming barren. No waiting for hot water. They sent me away with apples and walnuts and hugs.

Wifi works really well. The apartment is in the heart of Sofia. Again, I recommend this rent."", ""Great location and big room. The housemates (unfortunately I haven\u2019t met Dimitar) are really nice and easy going. Dimitar is easy to communicate with. Despite the nice hosts, I wouldn\u2019t recommend the place.

They are very friendly and comunicative, like almost every person we met during those days."", ""2 stars for the location. Besides that very dirty bathroom and kitchen area. Hot water went out and the AC didn't work which would only be an issue if you are traveling in the summer. However, if you pay for something you'd expect it to be available. That being said there are many other places I would have booked if I knew the AC was out. First disappointing Airbnb in the 3 months I've been on the road. "", ""Great place in central location, yet on a side street so it is a lot quieter.

Within a few meters you're right at Vitosha Boulevard and the metro stops Serdika and NDK are close by.

Overall, the people and the cat living in the flat were very welcoming\n\nThe room was as described and pictured. It really does get a lot of sun! Which was especially welcomed, since I was there during January. The bed was comfortable and I was warm in the room despite the negative temperatures outside.

Totally recommend!"", ""The location of the place is great in the very centre of Sofia very convenient and with easy access to public transportation. The communication with the host was excellent. I recommend it for couples. A single lady might not feel very comfortable... I had weird experience during my stay which doesn't make the place bad it was the building where it is located. The apartment is part of an old house and the staircase is a bit creepy... In the first night of my stay there was a stranger lying and sleeping on the stairs in the lower floor (probably drunk neighbour or homeless person) which really scared me..."", ""This was our first Airbnb experience and we are happy that it was in Luchezar's place. It is wonderful: great location (3 minutes walk to the main pedestrian street Vitoshka, rich in cafeterias, restaurants, bars and night clubs), also close to archaeological and cultural sites; very well equipped kitchen, there is everything you might need to prepare meal, tea/ coffee. The atmosphere is really nice and cosy, we felt like home, still it's stylish. It's even better than on the pictures. It was not a problem for our late arrival, nor checking-in on our own. Lucho is really helpful. Totally recommended."", ""The place was really cozy and super cute!

Unfortunately from the second evening there was loud music from the apartment downstairs which was played until late, this is not the fault of the host obviously, however it was really annoying for us.

Everything was provided and clean. He also helped me deliver a gift I left behind to my aunt. Wonderful host. Highly recommended."", ""Luchesar is a great host and always sorts out any problems quickly without fuss. I always stay here when I come to Sofia and I intend to do so again in the future."", ""The apartment is bright, tastefully decorated and very close to the city center. Do not pay attention to the entrance of the building. In Sofia, often the common parts of the buildings (stairs, entrance etc.) are not very welcoming, but they do not necessarily reflect the quality of the apartments. The Luchesar apartment is one of the nicest I've ever seen in Sofia!"", ""Lucho was in England so we never met him, but he was available online for any question or concern. His flat is up 3 flights of stairs (no lift!) on the top floor of an older building, in a quiet street a couple of blocks from the \""Las Ramblas\"" of Sofia: the very central Vitosha Boulevard.\u00a0 It's an older, traditional building accessed through a locked gate. The keys are in a lockbox just inside the gate, which is easy to reach. The tricky part is opening the gate, as the 2-step mechanism is old and not user-friendly. Make sure you ask Lucho for an extensive, in-depth description of which key to use and how exactly to use it - as it took us a good 20 minutes of exasperation in order to manage to get the gate unlocked. Once we figured out the trick, it was relatively simple, but it can be very tricky the first time! Other than that, the access to the flat was straightforward. Inside the flat there's a good mix of traditional and modern. The Wi-Fi and TV are great (we brought our own Chromecast so we watched our Netflix). There's one futon couch and two lounge chairs in the living room (NOT the second couch pictured, so probably the pictures uploaded here are old).\u00a0 The kitchen has an electric cook-top and oven, but no microwave. There's some pots and pans, crockery, cutlery, cups and glasses provided but it's not a kitchen set up for cooking up a storm as only basic things are provided. Salt, pepper and oil were provided, as well as tea and ground coffee. An electric kettle, a mocha coffee maker and a washing machine with a drying rack were provided.\u00a0 The bathroom is small, with a small shower. There's some random liquid soaps provided in the shower: the labels all said they were orange hand washes but I'm pretty sure the bottles had been refilled with shower gel. There was also some body lotion and hair gel. The bathroom has 3 windows with clear glass and no privacy screens, so I felt extremely uncomfortable as I felt I was being watched from the windows of the adjacent buildings outside. Especially at night! There was a small mirror propped up against the window on top of the sink which fell over because of the wind, so maybe there's no more mirror in the bathroom (or perhaps Lucho organized for a new one to be properly installed). More clarity on the products would've been appreciated, also in regards to the cleaning products as all the labels were in Cyrillic so it was next to impossible to figure out which bottle contained the laundry detergent and what was the correct dosage to use.\u00a0 In regards to the cleanliness, the apartment was relatively clean but far from spotless. The shower drain was full of the previous guest's hair so we immediately contacted Lucho who organized for a cleaner to come clean the bathroom first thing..."", ""Luchesar\u2019s place was comfortable and central, and felt safe.

I actually think Luchesar's place could be amazing if he could fix a few little things. First, the broken toilet. The sit of the toilet is broken and it would pinch my skin every time I used it. NOT FUN haha \nThen, if you are highly allergic to dust, witch thankfully I am not, I wouldn't stay here. All behind the bed, the coach, the borders of the room were all dusty. \nAlso, the kitchen looks amazing in pictures, but there is no soap to clean the dishes. He offers coffee and for the amount of days we stayed there, I thought he would have enough for us, but he didn't. Then, when we kindly asked him if he had any extra, he actually told us to go to the supermarket. - Cool...- \nFinally, it is true that he says that because the building is old it has some character (I am from Costa Rica....I can deal with some character), but the building at night is freaking creepy, there is no lights and when we would open the door of the building to go up to the apartment there would be NO light at all...I wish I could put pictures...the picture would be black haha!! :P \nIt was pretty scary and I was with my boyfriend witch made me feel safer, but I could not imaging coming back home alone at night....\n\nPositives: The bed was comfy, the place is big, nicely decorated, close to many coffee shops, restaurants, and 10 minutes to the centre.\n\nI would not pass on this cool place, but I would make sure first that he fixed the toilet, fixed the lights on the building, cleaned the apartment properly, there is soap to clean the dishes, and enough coffee if that is one of the reasons that made you rent this apartment."", ""The flat is cozy and warm, we loved it.

The lovely apartment is located at one of the ancient Sofia's street where you can either enjoy just walking to the top center of the city or trying French, Italian, or Bulgarian cuisine in the cozy restaurants that are located at the this street. Generally, the stay exceeded my expectations. For my next visit, I will be back there for sure!"", ""Rados apartment is in the fifth floor, well renewed and has everything a guest needs: a full equipped kitchen, a comfortable bed, two nice balconies and a professional secured front door. The flat is calm, so I could sleep with open windows. The whole house is renovated and the neighbors are calm and friendly. Wifi works perfectly. Rado is absolutely reliable, answers within minutes. He lives in the same house. The apartment isn't in downtown, but in a walking distance of twenty minutes. Around the corner is a shopping mall and a big grocery store from Billa. All in all: I felt quickly at home, and I would always rent Rados apartment again."", ""This was a wonderful place to spend a couple days in Sofia.

Radostin was a great host and responded to all my questions promptly."", ""Rad has been a great host and communicating with him has been really easy at all times. His flat looked actually better than in the pictures, it was comfortable and really clean and he provided us with everything we needed: brochures, towels, gel, etc. Rad even showed us around the city and explained many historical details about the past of Sofia while he invited us to have a beer with him. He also helped us with the schedule for buses and other means of transport, so he was very helpful all the time. The last day he even invited us to try homemade rakia his family had made for him. We couldn't be happier after this stay in his nice apartment in Sofia, so we totally recommend it. We will see you in Valencia! Regards, Pablo and Ricard"", ""Rado's flat was very cozy and had everything what guests might need. Balconies, which we loved the most in his flat, have tables for a lovely coffee time. There will be almost every equipments you might need. Even there are slippers!\nThe location is not at the super center but you can experience the local life with a shopping center(just 2minutes walk), bakery, bank, cafe, beauty salon, pharmacies etc... nearby. It has quiet and friendly neighborhood and also you can easily reach the center on foot or public transportation. \nOur check-in time was almost midnight due to the flight delay. Rado thankfully waited for us for pick-up. \nDuring our stay, my friend had to go to the pharmacy for a painkiller late at night. Rado replied us immediately and  sent us the address of pharmacy nearby. He was always ready to give us help. :-)\nWe were lucky to stay at his place. I would definately stat at his place if I visit Sofia again ^_^"", ""The place was extremly nice: comfortable, spacious. The balcony was as cool as he described it, there was no chance to disappoint in anything. He was precise when we arrived (even though we late pretty much) and also helped with the leaving with the same precision. The apartment had a lot of small positive things that we appreciated it much (3in1 coffee, more towels, basic kitchen equipments and shopping bags(!) maps, etc.). It was basically as professional as a hotel room. \n\nThe building is very well located, good starting point for a trip in the center but we could reach Vitosha with metro and bus easily. \n\nOFF: I would highly recommend the daily tickets for public transport. It's only 4 leva and we could reach many places with it. \n\nFinally big thanks to you Radostin for everything, if I road will lead back to Sofia I would choose it again. :)"", ""Had to come back to Sofia in a short period. Obvious choice was Radostin's place. Again a very comfortable stay and the host being professional and helpful. Recommend to everyone!"", ""The place is very clean, nicely renovated and is in a great center neighborhood. There is a big shopping center next to the building and most of the parks and must see places in Sofia are pretty close.\nRado and Vikki are nice, always replying within minutes to messages and always there to help.\nAs my flight was arriving at 2:30 a.m. they waited for me and even picked me up from the airport.\nThey gave me some great recommendations to walk trough the city and for a Bulgarian restaurant. I would definitely stay again with them!"", ""Nice and friendly neighbourhood. Radostin was a great host, looked after my needs at all times. The flat is cosy and comfortable.

One is that there is a full-size living area in which one can actually sit down and have a beer or watch some TV after a hard day's work.

After talking to Alex (quite funny communication as he winded up in one excuse to a next) the female cleaner came and really picked up 5mins all the hairs of the bed linen and left afterwards again. So this was her cleaning the bed. Luckily there has been a washing machine in the kitchen, otherwise we would have definitely left the apartment immediately. I like to say to it, that I am not a very picky person common to cleanliness as a lot of my trips I just do camping in my own tent and living in a German flat share with 3 other men, but this just has been too much. After walking 1-2 minutes barefoot on the floor, your feet have been black, in the bath there were long haired hairs and the table in the kitchen was sprinkled with foodsauce and other shit. We refused to have a better look on some other things and tried to be out in the city as much as possible. \n \nAs well some of the domestic equipments weren't as told in the description. Part of that our stay was okay, as the apartment has a top position to have a look over the attractions in the city or even to visit the mountains. Still we would never book one of his apartments again. \n\n\n\n\nGerman/Deutsch:\nW\u00fcrden und werden diese Wohnung nie wieder buchen. Die Sauberkeit lie\u00df extrem stark zum W\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig. Die Bettw\u00e4sche wurde defintiv nicht gewechselt und so fanden sich Haare \u00fcberall auf dem Bett, die nach mehrmaligen Kontakt mit Alex von dessen Reinigungskraft einzeln eingesammelt wurden, w\u00e4hrend die Bettw\u00e4sche belassen wurde. Nach 5min hatte mich der Ekel von dieser Vorgehensweise so gepackt, dass ich mir nur noch gew\u00fcnscht hatte, dass sie bald das Apartment verl\u00e4sst, was sie nach 10min auch machte und ich die Bettw\u00e4sche in die Waschmaschine schmei\u00dfen konnte. Auch der Boden, der K\u00fcchentisch, sowie das Bad lie\u00dfen stark zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig und eigentlich waren wir uns beide sehr sicher, dass die Wohnung h\u00f6chstens 5min \""geputzt\"" (M\u00fcllt\u00fctenwechsel und neue Handt\u00fccher bereitgelegt) wurde, nachdem unsere Vorg\u00e4nger sie verlassen hatten. Wenn man sich \u00fcberlegt wie hoch der Preis der Wohnung ist (etwa 32euro pro Nacht bei 3 N\u00e4chten) und wie viel eine Reinigungskraft in Bulgarien wohl pro Stunde verdient (wahrscheinlich weniger als 5 Euro), kann man nicht verstehen, dass so wenig wert auf die Sauberkeit und Zufriedenheit der Besucher gelegt wird.  \nW\u00fcrden somit allein aufgrund der Sauberkeit diese Wohnung niemals wieder buchen und das obwohl wir beiden nicht gerade sehr ordentlich sind und gerne auch mal 2-3 Wochen am St\u00fcck mit Backpack und Zelt durch die Welt campen. \nAuch einiges an Equipment, welches in der Beschreibung aufgef\u00fchrt wurde, fehlte und so muss man einfach sagen, dass es bis auf die wirklich excellente Lage einfach nicht dem entsprach was wir uns vorgestellt hatten und sehr entt\u00e4uscht \u00fcber die Wohnung waren."", ""Si fa prima a dire cosa non c'\u00e8 in casa di Alex che non cosa c'\u00e8.\nProfessionalita estrema.\nSempre disponibile in tutto pur non essendoci mai incontrati.\nLe modalit\u00e0 di check in sono FUTURISTICHE.\nVicinissimo al centro.

We found that we could buy the daily transport card (4 lev) from the little kiosk on Opalchenska street outside the Mall. We used the tram and metro to go downtown when we didn't walk the 20 minutes to get there.\nWe can recommend the 33 Gastronauts restaurant, very cool and cosy with great food and the Rainbow Factory caf\u00e9 was a very nice find too.\nWe will definitely choose one of Tanya & Alex\u2019s apartments the next we are in Sofia."", ""Everything was perfect!

If you are traveling with a car this is the place to go to!  In addition, the place is spotless cleaned and offers everything that you could need. Our stay at this apartment was more like an experience in its own way because every detail in this apartment is so thoughtful, you simply dont want to leave and just want to stay inside and enjoy the coziness and warmth that the ambient reflects. I would like to say thank you to both Alex and Tanya for making our stay so good and worth it.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"", ""Tanya and Alex are great hosts. They provide all the information you need and will reply quickly to anything you ask. Their place is just like in the pictures, only with even more nice details! It was clean and well equipped.

A good place to take a rest after a long day of visiting the city. The facilities are good if you want to make your own food.\nWe really liked to go to the fleamarket with Alex as our guide. \nThe apartment is near the metrostation and a supermarket and close to the city.\nWe also liked the tips in the guide for places to eat or to buy local stuff.\nIt really is a nice place to stay if you want to visit Sofia"", ""Attention to detail, this is what mostly differentiates this amazing apartment! From the coffee creamers left to supplement my morning wake-up ritual, to spare bulbs in the drawer just in case, or a hairdryer, or thick curtains for a good sleep, to shampoo & shower gel in the bathroom or tea or comfy slippers...the comfort is greater than expected. \n\nIt is our second time in this apartment and certainly not the last one. Thank you, Tanya and Alex, for being such great ambassadors of Sofia."", ""This beautiful apartment and the hosts are the epitome of Airbnb perfection. Gorgeous mid century design, warm and cosy ambience, comfy bedrooms, small but well designed bathroom and kitchen with everything you need to comfortably enjoy staying at home while perfectly located in the centre of the city to access all the sights and cool restaurants in Sofia. The check in process was super easy thanks to Alex and he was always quick to respond to any questions we had. We even loved our stay so much we booked another week in their other gorgeous Airbnb apartment! These guys have also gone to the effort of creating a great guide to Sofia as well as provide a cool flea market tour. If you\u2019re into mid century design and appreciate thoughtful touches and great hospitality then this is the perfect Airbnb experience for you. Thank you Tanya and Alex!!"", ""Cosy, stylish, with a heart & soul and an individual touch...we could go on like this for a long time, as this apartment is a true jewel in the centre of Sofia.\n\nImmaculate communication, cleanness, proximity and you name it.

Five stars, ticks all the boxes. Very stylish, lots of space! Tanya & Alexander are great: nice and communicative. The apartment is brand new so super clean, its very quiet and the beds are sooo comfy with great smelling soft sheets. \nOn saturday morning Alex took us to the gypsy market wich is a very cool expierence.

Hoewel we heb niet in real live hebben gezien, ging de communicatie met Alex en Tanya vlot. Vanuit het appartement sta je in een kwartier wandelen midden in de binnenstad van Sofia. Dankzij het winkelcentrum aan de overkant zit een supermarkt dichtbij. Geen zin om te wandelen? Het dichtstbijzijnde metrostation is maar 3 minuten lopen.
